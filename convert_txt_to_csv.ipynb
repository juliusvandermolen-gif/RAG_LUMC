      "Myelin is a key evolutionary specialization and adaptation of vertebrates formed by the plasma membrane of glial cells, which insulate axons in the nervous system. Myelination not only allows rapid and efficient transmission of electric impulses in the axon by decreasing capacitance and increasing resistance but also influences axonal metabolism and the plasticity of neural circuits. In this review, we will focus on Schwann cells, the glial cells which form myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we will describe the main extrinsic and intrinsic signals inducing Schwann cell differentiation and myelination and how myelin biogenesis is achieved. Finally, we will also discuss how the study of human disorders in which molecules and pathways relevant for myelination are altered has enormously contributed to the current knowledge on myelin biology.\n",
