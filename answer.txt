Answer:
The provided documents do not explicitly list synonyms for IDH1 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1), but they do reference various biological pathways and proteins that may interact with or relate to metabolic processes involving IDH1. 

IDH1 is primarily known for its role in the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), where it catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate, producing NADPH in the process. This reaction is crucial for cellular metabolism and energy production. IDH1 is also involved in the regulation of cellular redox state and has implications in cancer metabolism, particularly in gliomas where mutations in IDH1 lead to the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate, an oncometabolite that can affect epigenetic regulation.

The pathways mentioned, such as the pentose phosphate metabolism (WP134), highlight the interconnectedness of metabolic pathways where IDH1 may play a role in generating NADPH, which is essential for biosynthetic reactions and maintaining cellular redox balance. The oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway, involving glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), is critical for generating NADPH, which complements the function of IDH1.

In the context of cancer, the documents reference various signaling pathways and microRNA networks that may influence or be influenced by metabolic changes associated with IDH1 activity. For instance, the microRNA targeting cancer growth (WP3593) and the regulation of MSMP expression in cancer cells (WP4397) suggest a complex regulatory network where IDH1's metabolic role could intersect with oncogenic signaling pathways.

In summary, while the documents do not provide direct synonyms for IDH1, they emphasize its metabolic function and potential interactions within broader biological processes, particularly in the context of cancer metabolism and signaling pathways. Understanding these interactions is crucial for elucidating the role of IDH1 in both normal physiology and pathological conditions.
