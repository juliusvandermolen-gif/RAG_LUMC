## g:Profiler Comparison Summary
Here is a comparison of your GPT-derived pathways against the ground-truth (gProfiler) list. “Hit” pathways have clear, biologically relevant counterparts in the gProfiler results; “No Hit” pathways lack a close match and may represent under-annotated or highly specific processes.

Summary:

• Four out of five GPT-derived pathways (“hits”) align with broad developmental or structural processes found by gProfiler.  
  – Axon guidance is a core KEGG pathway (04360), critical for wiring neural circuits.  
  – Myelination (myelin sheath) ensures rapid signal conduction; glial differentiation per se may be under-annotated.  
  – Vesicle and endomembrane annotations reflect intracellular transport and scaffolding dynamics.  
  – System/developmental processes capture the essence of neurogenesis and neural maturation.  

• Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling did not appear in the ground truth. This likely reflects (a) the fine-grained, synapse-specific nature of plasticity terms that are under-represented in broad GO/REAC sets, or (b) statistical thresholds in gProfiler that favored more general developmental and structural categories.

Summary:
- Across all seven genes, GeneCards does not list Gene Ontology annotations specifically tied to “synaptic plasticity & signaling.”
- No peer-reviewed articles with verified titles were identified that explicitly link these genes to the pathway.
- Therefore, based on current GeneCards GO terms and a targeted literature search, there is no direct evidence supporting the involvement of Prss12, Synpr, Sipa1l1, Mef2c, Lrrtm3, Cntn6, or Efna5 in “Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling.”

Summary:
- GeneCards GO annotations support axon-guidance roles for nine of the ten genes (all except CDH13). CDH13 is annotated for homophilic cell adhesion, consistent with neuronal connectivity but not explicitly axon guidance.
- Peer-reviewed primary-research evidence explicitly linking these genes to axon guidance was found only for NTN1 (Kennedy et al., 1994). 
- No direct experimental citations were identified for SEMA4F, SEMA3G, ROBO2, SLIT2, SRGAP1, PLXNB1, DPYSL3, DPYSL5 or CDH13, indicating gaps between GO-based predictions and explicit literature demonstrations. Further targeted studies or deeper literature mining may be needed to confirm their roles in this pathway.

Summary:
All seven genes exhibit GeneCards GO annotations related to myelination and/or the myelin sheath, supporting their involvement in Myelination & Glial Differentiation. Peer-reviewed literature provides direct experimental evidence for MPZ, MAG, DRP2, and GLDN. No suitable peer-reviewed publications explicitly linking PMP22, PRX, or MAL to myelination/glial differentiation were found, indicating gaps where further targeted studies may be needed.

Summary:
- GeneCards GO annotations confirm that all seven genes participate in cytoskeletal organization or vesicle-mediated transport processes.
- Targeted PubMed/Google Scholar searches yielded a direct, peer-reviewed demonstration of **KIF1A**’s role in microtubule-based intracellular transport (Okada et al., 1995, *Cell*).
- For **TUBA4A**, **TUBB4A**, **SEPTIN4**, **SEPTIN5**, **PFN2**, and **RAB10**, no specific, experimentally focused publications were identified that explicitly link each gene to the pathway “Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport,” indicating gaps in directly cited functional studies for those gene-pathway relationships.

Summary:
- All eleven genes carry the GO annotation GO:0022008 (neurogenesis) in GeneCards, indicating a putative role in neural development.
- Under strict search of peer-reviewed literature databases, no publications were identified that explicitly validate each gene’s involvement in the “Neurogenesis & Neural Development” pathway by title and quotation.
- While GeneCards GO terms support potential participation, explicit functional studies linking these genes to the pathway were not found, suggesting that further targeted literature review or experimental validation is necessary.
