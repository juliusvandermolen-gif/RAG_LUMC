After the measurement, supernatant from the cells was removed and the cells were ﬁxed by addition of 100 mL 3.7%
PFA (Merck) for 10 min at RT and air dried. Subsequently, the cells were stained using 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma) solution (in20% Ethanol). For quantiﬁcation, stained plates were incubated with 200 ml of 10% acetic acid per well with shaking for 15 min
and the resulting solution was analyzed in a plate reader (Multiskan Ascent from Thermo labsystems) at 550 nm and the values
were used for normalization of the seahorse data. QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We performed power calculations based on our prior knowledge of variation in tumor latency, frequency, and progression. Thus, we
used the minimal number of mice sufﬁcient to detect the effect of interest and obtain reproducible, statistically signiﬁcant, and bio-
logically meaningful results. For example, we expected a two-fold difference in mean (M) tumor size in transgenic models between
two groups, with a standard deviation (SD) of less than 50%.

Lipid meta-
bolism is frequently disrupted in cancers, but the underlying basis is unclear. A multi-institution team of researchers inves-tigated the metabolism of cancers driven by MYC, one of the most powerful oncogenes. Using a highly sensitive imagingapproach called desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, the tissue metabolism of MYC-cancer models
and MYC-driven human cancers was measured in situ . The team found comprehensive evidence that MYC, in collaboration
with DNA transcription factor SREBP1, regulates the production of lipids, and that this is necessary to both initiate and sus-tain cancer formation. Therefore, blocking lipid production may be a promising therapeutic strategy to combat MYC-drivencancers. 556 Cell Metabolism 30, 556–572, September 3, 2019 ª2019 Elsevier Inc.
cells need building blocks for new membranes, which can be
assembled either from exogenous lipids or via endogenous
de novo lipogenesis. Whether lipogenesis is regulated solely by
MYC or collaboratively with other factors is not known.

This is consistent with the promoter-binding
data from ChIP-seq in BCL ( Figures S5 A and S5B). Hence,
MYC regulates genes that increase the production and incorpo-ration of long unsaturated FAs. MYC Alters Glycerophosphatidylinositol Metabolism in a
Tissue-Dependent MannerNotably, MYC has tissue-speciﬁc effects on glycerophosphati-
dylinositol (PI) metabolism. Thus, in RCC and T-ALL, MYC
reversibly decreased PIs, but in LC and HCC MYC ratherincreased these phospholipids as measured by DESI-MSI ( Fig-
ures 5 A and S5C; for tissue H&E staining, Figure S4 B; for fold
change, Figure S5 D). PIs have inositol as the phosphate group
substituent, and they are competitively synthesized with PGs
from the common CDP-DAG pool ( Figure 6 A) (Batenburg et al.,
1985; Liu et al., 2014; Quirk et al., 1984 ). Signiﬁcant PGS1 and
PTPMT1 induction may preferentially promote CDP-DAG con-
version to PGs, which could then shunt metabolites away from
PI synthesis. One explanation is that MYC increases PIs in LCbecause of lung surfactants that are rich in both PGs and PIs(Agassandian and Mallampalli, 2013; Fickes et al., 2016; Griese
et al., 1991 ).

In
addition, PS has a strong stimulatory e ﬀect on the activity of the ER-
localized Sac1 phosphatase [ 54]. The consequence of this regulation is
that excess PS production, as in the case in the Lenz-Majewski PSS1mutations, stimulates Sac1 activity and therefore a ﬀects the PI4P gra-
dient across all ER contact sites causing secondary alterations in thetransport of other lipids that rely upon the PI4P-drivenT. Balla, et al. BBA - Molecular and Cell Biology of Lipids 1865 (2020) 158461

countertransport mechanism [ 12]. The fact that PI4P can be removed from the PM by ORP5 and ORP8
has important implications to the production of the PI(4,5)P 2within the
PM, for which PI4P also serves as a precursor. The fact that PM re-
cruitment of the N-terminal PH domain and adjacent polybasic motifs
of ORP5 and ORP8 relies on the levels of both PI4P and PI(4,5)P 2in the
PM ensures that when PI4P or PI(4,5)P 2levels are low, these LTPs cease
working. Alternatively, when PI(4,5)P 2levels are increasing, ORP8
joins ORP5 and by delivering more PI4P to the ER, they limit theamount of PI4P available for PI(4,5)P
2production [ 55].

INTRODUCTION
The MYC oncogene is often activated and/or overexpressed in
cancers ( Baudino and Cleveland, 2001; Cawley et al., 2004;
Dang, 2012; Fernandez et al., 2003; Kalkat et al., 2017; Kolket al., 2009; Wang et al., 1999 ). The MYC transcription factor di-
merizes with MAX, binds to DNA, ampliﬁes gene expression
genome-wide, and regulates multiple cellular programs,including proliferation, metabolism, self-renewal, angiogenesis,
and immune evasion ( Blackwood et al., 1992; Casey et al.,
2018; Dang et al., 2006; Grieb et al., 2016; McMahon, 2014 ). Experimentally, MYC inactivation regresses tumors ( Casey
et al., 2018; Gabay et al., 2014; Shroff et al., 2015 ); however,
there are still no therapies that target MYC directly. MYC has
been shown to generally regulate glycolysis and glutaminolysis,which are required for energy production and macromolecular
synthesis ( Dang, 2012; Wahlstro ¨m and Henriksson, 2015;
Wang et al., 2011; Wise et al., 2008 ). MYC-stimulated growing
