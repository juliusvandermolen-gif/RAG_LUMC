## g:Profiler Comparison Summary
### Comparison of GPT-supplied pathways with gProfiler (ground-truth) pathways

| Pathway (GPT List) | Validation (Hit / No Hit) | Novel or Common | Matched Pathway in gProfiler List | Annotation Term (GO / KEGG / REAC) |
|--------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling | **Hit** | Common | Cell surface receptor signaling pathway / Regulation of signaling | GO:0007166 / GO:0023051 |
| Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity | **Hit** | Common | Axon guidance | KEGG:04360 (also GO:0048846) |
| Myelination & Glial Differentiation | **Hit** | Common | Myelin sheath | GO:0043209 |
| Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport | **No Hit** | Novel / Too specific | – | – |
| Neurogenesis & Neural Development | **Hit** | Common | System development / Developmental process | GO:0048731 / GO:0032502 |

### Interpretative summary

1. Validated (Hit) pathways  
   • Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling – Captured in gProfiler through broad “cell surface receptor signaling pathway” and “regulation of signaling” terms, reflecting the molecular cascades that modulate synaptic strength.  
   • Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity – Directly matches the KEGG “Axon guidance” pathway, essential for wiring the nervous system.  
   • Myelination & Glial Differentiation – Aligns with the “myelin sheath” term, highlighting processes that insulate axons and accelerate nerve conduction.  
   • Neurogenesis & Neural Development – Falls under multiple development-related GO categories (system development, developmental process), emphasizing formation and maturation of neural tissue.

2. Non-validated (No Hit) pathway  
   • Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport – While individual genes may overlap with “vesicle,” “endomembrane system,” or “cell motility,” gProfiler did not return an explicit cytoskeletal term in this result set. Possible reasons include:  
     – The input gene list was enriched for other cellular components, so cytoskeletal terms did not reach significance.  
     – The phrase combines two concepts (cytoskeleton remodeling and intracellular trafficking) that are often split across separate GO terms, diluting enrichment power.

### Overall
Four of the five GPT-listed pathways show clear or functionally proximate matches to the ground-truth gProfiler results, underscoring coherence between the two analyses. “Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport” appears novel with respect to the current gProfiler output and may warrant further investigation or a broader statistical threshold.

Summary  
• GeneCards provides basic Gene Ontology annotations for all queried genes, but these annotations alone do not confirm a direct role in synaptic plasticity & signaling.  
• No peer-reviewed, pathway-specific evidence satisfying the required verification criteria could be located for any of the genes (accurate title, source, and quotation).  
• Consequently, combined evidence remains insufficient to confirm the involvement of Prss12, Synpr, Sipa1l1, Mef2c, Lrrtm3, Cntn6, or Efna5 in the “Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling” pathway according to the strict validation standards specified.

Summary
• All ten genes carry GO annotations in GeneCards that directly list the Biological Process term “axon guidance,” lending Gene Ontology‐based support to their proposed involvement in the “Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity” pathway.  
• A thorough search of PubMed and Google Scholar identified no peer-reviewed primary research articles meeting the strict verification criteria (exact titles, direct quotations) that explicitly connect each specific gene to axon-guidance or neuronal-connectivity functions.  
• Consequently, at present only GeneCards GO information—but not corroborating academic literature—supports the association of these genes with the pathway, leaving a notable evidence gap that warrants further investigation.

### Myelination & Glial Differentiation

Summary  
• GeneCards GO annotations support the association of all seven genes (Mpz, Mag, Pmp22, Prx, Drp2, Gldn, Mal) with processes directly related to myelination or the myelin sheath.  
• A focused search of PubMed and Google Scholar did not locate peer-reviewed articles that could be verified with exact titles and quotations explicitly linking these genes to “Myelination & Glial Differentiation” in the required citation format.  
• This represents a clear evidence gap: GeneCards GO information suggests involvement, but corroborating primary-literature proof (meeting the strict citation criteria) could not be confirmed for any of the genes.

### Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport
**Genes involved:** Tuba4a, Tubb4a, Kif1a, Septin4, Septin5, Pfn2, Rab10

Summary  
• GeneCards GO annotations clearly place all seven genes in processes directly related to cytoskeletal organization and/or intracellular transport.  
• Peer-reviewed evidence could be verified only for KIF1A, conclusively confirming its role in intracellular transport.  
• For Tuba4a, Tubb4a, Septin4, Septin5, Pfn2, and Rab10, no paper with an accurately verifiable title and quotation explicitly linking them to the stated pathway could be identified in PubMed or Google Scholar under the required constraints.  
• Consequently, strong support exists for KIF1A, while the remaining gene–pathway associations currently lack confirmatory literature evidence based on the stringent verification criteria applied here.

Summary
• GeneCards GO annotations link every listed gene to processes directly relevant to neurogenesis or neural development.  
• Verified peer-reviewed literature supporting pathway involvement was located for Nestin (Nes) and Numb only.  
• For Id2, Dyrk1a, Atf5, Klf9, Msi1, Peg3, Igfbp3, Lifr and Cxcl12 no suitably verified, pathway-specific papers could be confirmed under the strict title-accuracy requirements; therefore “No evidence found” has been recorded.  
• Overall, combined evidence firmly supports Nes and Numb in the Neurogenesis & Neural Development pathway, while additional experimentally validated literature remains to be located for the remaining genes.
