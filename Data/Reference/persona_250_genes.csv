nal transport have the potentiality to cure many hereditary neuro -
pathies irrespective of the primary triggering defect: this is the case 
for the inhibitors of SARM1 and of HDAC6, an active field of research. ●Intervention on more specific metabolic pathways is also promising, 
such as for L-Serine to treat HSN1 by reducing neurotoxic deoxy -
sphingolipids, or compounds acting on the PYKfive enzyme in the 
phosphoinositides metabolism in CMT4B, or S-adenosylmethionine

of sorbitol. Inhibitors of aldose reductase, developed in the past for

Next, we asked whether the disease biomarkers identified in 
the C22 transcriptomic study can be confirmed in the CMT1A rat 
model. Consistent with findings in C22 mice, the mRNA levels of lipid biosynthetic genes such as Sc5d and Ugt8a were decreased in CMT1A rats, although to a lesser extent than in C22 mouse nerves. ASO6 treatment trended toward increased mRNA levels of these genes (Figure 3G). Furthermore, the mRNA levels of Id2  
and Bzw2  were significantly increased in CMT1A rats compared 
with WT rats and were substantially decreased following ASO6 treatment (Figure 3G). Finally, we sought to identify a target engagement biomarker 
in the CMT1A rats. Toward this end, we collected blood and foot -
pad skin biopsies from treated CMT1A rats. Although there was detectable rat Pmp22 mRNA in the blood, there was no change in Pmp22 levels following ASO6 treatment (Supplemental Fig -

A consistent slow NCV of < 38 m/s in the
arms represents the demyelinating form of CMT1, whereas a value >38 m/s is distinctive
of the axonal form of CMT2. Transitional NCVs (25–45 m/s) are often observed in males
with CMTX1 and in patients with other transitional patterns of CMT [4]. The genetic diagnosis of CMT has been conducted by implementing the targeted next-
generation sequencing and whole-exome sequencing approaches. Over 120 gene mutations
are related to the pathogenesis of CMT and associated neuropathies [ 5,6]. The frequency of
the various types of CMT varies by region and the age at which they were published. In

Identification of 
a well- established marker of axonal disease, G3BP1, substantiates 
the notion that irrespective of the cellular origin of the neuropathy, 
the dynamic interplay between the axon and myelinated glia is per-
turbed early- on in affected nerves. This unbiased global proteomic study confirms our previous 
work on the involvement of degradative pathways in PMP22-  
linked neuropathies (Fortun et al., 2003; Notterpek et al., 1997). Since PMP22, the disease- causing protein, is prone to aggregation 
when mutated or overexpressed (Notterpek, Ryan, et al., 1999), 
the mistrafficked protein induces a proteostatic dysbalance (Fortun 
et al., 2003). Dysregulated proteins identified in this study include 
autophagy- related cathepsins B, C, D, and Z, lysosomal- associated 
membrane protein 2, and several other molecules that comprise the 
lysosome and proteasome pathways (Figures 5 and 6 ). Recent ev-
idence suggests that the close regulation of autophagy is directly 
related to the pathobiology of neurodegeneration and is linked 
to the clearance of intracellular waste in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, 
and Huntington's diseases (Song et al., 2021)."

However, while high-fat diet can partially compensate for a deﬁciency in fatty
acid synthesis in the CNS, in the PNS a high fat diet results in worsening of myelin defects when fatty
acid synthesis is impaired [ 110,111]. The mechanisms underlying di erential e ects in the CNS vs.
PNS remain to be determined. Taken together the current literature suggests that the uptake of fatty
acid may not be the primary pathway for myelin formation. However, the importance of fatty acid
uptake contributing to the energetic metabolism of myelinating cells and axonal trophic support is
still unclear. Finally, there is also new evidence that lipids could be provided to myelin cells by neurons. A recent study found that fatty acids are released by hyperactive neurons and can be taken up by
neighboring glia to protect neurons from fatty acid toxicity [158]. 11. Fatty Acid Oxidation
The nervous system has very high metabolic demands. Notably the CNS consumes 20% of
the body’s oxygen supply. While the metabolic requirements for neural activity have been well
characterized, the energetic requirement for myelin formation and maintenance, as well as the
mechanisms for energetic production in myelinating cells, are not well understood [ 159]."

Thus, by analogy with epithelial cell polar -
ity, the abaxonal membrane of myelinated fibers is defined as a basolateral-like region, whereas the adaxonal membrane, SLI, paranodes and microvilli are considered apical-like regions [18, 19]. Schwann Cell Development
During early vertebrate development, neural crest cells delaminate from the neural tube, proliferate, and migrate to generate a broad spectrum of cell types including, among others, Schwann cells, melanocytes, sympathetic neurons, sensory neurons, and skeletal and connective tissues of the head [24– 26]. The cell fate largely depends from the region 
of origin of the neural tube from which neural crest cells migrate. These regions are defined in an anterior–posterior axis direction as cranial, cardiac, vagal, trunk, and sacral. In particular, Schwann cells, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons, sympathetic neurons, and satellite cells associated with sensory neurons, all originate from ventrally migrating trunk neural crest cells [27]."

CMT1A exhibits dysregulated lipid biosynthesis
Comparative microarrays were used to compare gene expression from sciatic nerves of WT rats with mildly and
severely affected CMT1A model rats expressing a 3rd WT PMP22 allele [ 24]. It was found that dysregulation of
22 lipid metabolism genes correlated with disease severity. In both mildly and severely affected animals mostexamined lipid metabolism genes were down-regulated at both 1 week and 9 weeks of age. Interestingly, there
was an age-dependent switch between mildly affected and severely affected rats with mildly affected rats exhibit-
ing more lipid biosynthetic gene dysregulation at 1 week of age and severely affected rats exhibiting more lipidbiosynthesis gene dysregulation at 9 weeks of age. Follow-up quantitative PCR experiments validated Adipoq,

In the outbred rat model of CMT1A,22rats can have varying 
levels of rodent Pmp22 expression, giving rise to a spectrum of pheno -
type severities, including variations in the expression of lipid 
metabolism-related genes.22,49To understand how these transcrip -
tional changes influence the CMT1A lipid profiles, we performed lipi-
domics on the sciatic nerves of 5-week-old C3 mice. Overall, the 
analysis revealed a major downregulation of lipid species in general, 
particularly of SPs, with SMs being the most affected in the sciatic 
nerves of C3 mice compared with their age-matched littermate con-
trols. In further support of these alterations, CMT1A rat sciatic nerve 
myelin exhibited significantly reduced levels of total cholesterol, PC, 
PE, plasmalogens, SM and ceramides.49
The correct PM lipid composition is essential for Schwann cells to 
interact with axons and to produce myelin, the multilamellar lipid- 
based structure. During Schwann cell lineage development, neural 
crest cells give rise to SCPs, which are guided to the most distal regions 
of the body by the extending peripheral axons.51Once interacting with 
axons, SCPs can differentiate into immature Schwann cells, which or-
ganize axons to be myelinated and non-myelinated in a process de-
fined as radial sorting.52To investigate the cellular origins of CMT1A 
lipid alterations, we developed a protocol to derive a Schwann cell lin-
eage from iPSCs."

Schwann cells express Sox10 at all stages of development 
as early as in migratory neural crest cells before lineage specification, thus suggesting that Sox10 is a key determi-nant of Schwann cell identity [41, 42]. Sox10 is also crucial 
in terminal differentiation and in myelin maintenance, as it controls the expression of several myelin genes encoding P0, MBP, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and Cx32 [33]. Conditional deletion in adult nerves showed that Sox10 
is also required for myelin homeostasis to maintain myelin integrity [43]. In mutant mice lacking Oct6, myelin genes are repressed 
and myelination is blocked [44, 45]. A double Oct6/Brn2  
KO model shows a more severe phenotype as compared to single Oct6 KO, thus suggesting that these factors cooperate 
to promote the transition to a myelinating phenotype. Even if more severe than the single KO, in Oct6/Brn2, double KO myelination is delayed but not completely blocked [46]. This finding led to the hypothesis that another factor such as Brn1 can in part compensate loss of Oct6 in vivo [47]."

This results in altered lipidomes, as
found in both animal and human derived samples. Combined, these data show that in CMTD SCs are unable to
generate the necessary lipids of myelin production and that this begins at the level of gene expression. PMP22 interacts with cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes
In their efforts to describe the glycosylation-dependent traf ﬁcking of PMP22 through the secretory phway to
the cell surface, Marinko et al. [ 29] conducted quantitative proteomics to identify PMP22 interactors. Some 56
proteins were seen to co-immunoprecipitate (co-IP) with WT PMP22, some of which were previously-documented PMP22 interactors, with many others on pathways (e.g. membrane protein integration, ER chaper-
one network, and ERAD degradation) that make sense based on what we know about the cellular traf ﬁcking
itinerary of PMP22. Included among these 56 proteins were PGRMC1, EMC4, DHCR7, DHCR24, TMEM97,and SURF4. All are related to cholesterol biosynthesis and cholesterol traf ﬁcking. Except for SURF4 and
TMEM97, the other four PMP22 interactors are related to cholesterol biosynthesis in the ER, constituting bio-
synthetic steps taking place after squalene synthesis ( Figure 2A )[30,31]."

In both cases, a single, continuous basal lamina covers

connective tissue (Pannese, 2010 ). During development, SGCs are 
derived from neural crest cells and likely furthermore originate from

Abstract
Myelin is a key evolutionary specialization and adaptation of vertebrates formed by the plasma membrane of glial cells, which insulate axons in the nervous system. Myelination not only allows rapid and efficient transmission of electric impulses in the axon by decreasing capacitance and increasing resistance but also influences axonal metabolism and the plasticity of neural circuits. In this review, we will focus on Schwann cells, the glial cells which form myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we will describe the main extrinsic and intrinsic signals inducing Schwann cell differentiation and myelination and how myelin biogenesis is achieved. Finally, we will also discuss how the study of human disorders in which molecules and pathways relevant for myelination are altered has enormously contributed to the current knowledge on myelin biology."

The neuropathic phenotype is promoted by low-grade inﬂammation from phagocytiz-
ing macrophages in mice models for CMT1A, CMT1B, and CMTX1. Colony-stimulating
factor (CSF1) is a macrophage activator expressed by endoneurial ﬁbroblasts. It mediates
macrophage-related neural impairment in mice and humans with CMT. Consequently, oral
administration of the CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX5622 followed by a vigorous
decrease in the number of macrophages in the peripheral nerves of Cx32def mice; more-
over, long-term CSF1R inhibition was reported to improve axonal integrity in these mice. However, although long-term CSF1R inhibition reduced the neuropathic patterns in P0het
mutants, it did not produce the same effect in PMP22 tg mutants [52]. 3.2.10. Sodium Channel Blockers

(PI), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) butnot in phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphati-
dylglycerol (PG) or cardiolipin levels in the brain [ 6]; suggesting that
PA made on the outer surface of the mitochondria by this enzyme has toﬁnd its way to the ER, where the a ﬀected phospholipids are known to
be made, and that not all phospholipid synthetic pathways are fed
uniformly through the action of this enzyme."

In the cortex, con-
ditional inactivation of cholesterol synthesis in neurons or oligo-dendrocytes resulted in moderate upregulation of cholesterol
synthesis genes, possibly to compensate for the loss of choles-
terol synthesis in the affected cell type ( Figure 1 E;Table S2 ). In
contrast, in all conditional mutants, we observed a moderatebut consistent downregulation of expression related to choles-
terol metabolism in white matter ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and S1
H). Here, reduced expression of genes associated with cholesteroltransport was noted in all conditional mutants, particularly in
AcKO animals ( Figure 1 F). In agreement, sterol proﬁling revealed
only moderate alteration in conditional mutants ( Figure S2 A). Surprisingly, corpus callosum of OLcKO and NcKO mice re-
vealed a marked downregulation of genes related to the blood-
brain barrier (BBB). This was accompanied by upregulation ofa few inﬂammatory mediators with proﬁles being unique toeach mutant ( Figures 1 E and 1F). Interestingly, by biochemical
quantiﬁcation of BBB permeability, the reduced tight junction
gene expression was paralleled by increased CNS inﬂux of thesmall-molecular-weight BBB tracer sodium ﬂuorescein (NaFl;
376 Da) in OLcKO and NcKO brains."

Transcriptional analysis of CMT1A patient iPSC-SCPs showed a 
downregulation of several genes related to Schwann cell myelin -
ation and development. In addition, key lipid metabolism genes 
were downregulated, including the cholesterol efflux transporters 
ATP binding cassette subfamily A 1 (ABCA1) and ABCA3. PMP22 is 
known to regulate ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux, because 
Pmp22 knockout drastically upregulated ABCA1 and led to LD accu -
mulations in the peripheral nerves.17In addition, Zhou et al.55
showed cholesterol sequestration to lysosomes and reduced 
ATP-binding cassette transporter-dependent cholesterol efflux in 
CMT1A patient fibroblasts. In CMT1A iPSC-SCPs, we showed that 
several genes relating to lipid homeostasis and storage were down -
regulated. Interestingly, the autophagy-associated genes LAMP1 and 
LAMP2 were dysregulated, whereas NPC1 and NPC2 were downregu -
lated. NPC1 and NPC2 are intracellular transporters that act in tan-
dem to remove cholesterol from the lysosomal compartment37,39,56
and regulate cholesterol homeostasis through the generation of 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-derived oxysterols.56Loss of 
function of NPC1 or NPC2 proteins is known to cause the lysosomal 
storage disease Niemann–Pick disease, type C1 and 2, respectively.37
GO enrichment analysis revealed dysregulation in genes regu -
lating PM components, transmembrane signalling receptor activity 
and biological adhesion, all of which are essential factors regulating 
axo-glial interactions and myelination maintenance.57,58Lipidomic analysis showed significant alterations in SP in CMT1A 
iPSC-SCPs."

therapies targeting axonal 
degeneration and axonal transport). The first trials with ascorbic acid for CMT1A were ineffective 
and highlighted the difficulties in translating preclinical posi -
tive results into successful clinical studies. The slow progres -
sion of CMT makes it difficult to demonstrate efficacy of any 
tested compound. Hence, research is also aimed at developing 
responsive outcome measures. In this paper we will review the most promising treatment 
in the pipeline as well as the current or planned clinical trials 
for CMT and related neuropathies. There is a wide variety of 
possible therapies under investigation, including those aimed 
at lowering PMP22 overexpression in CMT1A, the gene ther -
apy approaches to substitute, modulate or correct the defec -
tive genes, and compounds acting on the unfolded protein 
response (UPR) activated by misfolded protein accumulation, 
or working on myelination control mechanisms, or functioning 
specifically on metabolic pathways altered in certain CMT 
subtypes, or addressing common pathomechanisms underly -
ing several CMT forms."
