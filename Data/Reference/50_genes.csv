Next, we asked whether the disease biomarkers identified in 
the C22 transcriptomic study can be confirmed in the CMT1A rat 
model. Consistent with findings in C22 mice, the mRNA levels of lipid biosynthetic genes such as Sc5d and Ugt8a were decreased in CMT1A rats, although to a lesser extent than in C22 mouse nerves. ASO6 treatment trended toward increased mRNA levels of these genes (Figure 3G). Furthermore, the mRNA levels of Id2  
and Bzw2  were significantly increased in CMT1A rats compared 
with WT rats and were substantially decreased following ASO6 treatment (Figure 3G). Finally, we sought to identify a target engagement biomarker 
in the CMT1A rats. Toward this end, we collected blood and foot -
pad skin biopsies from treated CMT1A rats. Although there was detectable rat Pmp22 mRNA in the blood, there was no change in Pmp22 levels following ASO6 treatment (Supplemental Fig -
ure 5E). The level of rat Pmp22 mRNA in the footpad (containing dermal nerves and Schwann cells) was significantly reduced in ASO6- compared with control-treated rats, suggesting this could serve as a biomarker of target engagement (Figure 3H)."

These findings were consistent with the motor behavior and electrophysiology charac-terizations of the C22 cohort described in Figure 1. This was, to our knowledge, the first RNA-seq profiling of 
a CMT1A model, and the analysis showed some categories of 
genes in common with microarray profiles of other CMT1A mod-
els (34, 37 , 38). For example, there was a significant decrease in cholesterol and lipid biosynthetic genes as well as myelin-related genes in 5-week-old C22 compared with WT littermates (Supple -
mental Figure 2, C and F). The increased gene categories include a number involved in cell signaling, as well as those involved in axon guidance mechanisms (RhoA , Plxna1, and Rac1 ) and inte -
grin signaling (Itgb8 ) (Supplemental Figure 2D). Expression of 
myelin inhibitors such as Id2 , Id4, and Ednrb  was also increased, 
suggesting an unfavorable environment for remyelination (Sup -

showed that during development, lipid metabolism genes (including those of sterol metabolism) failed to
up-regulate in a CMT1A background compared with WT, suggesting a failure to engage lipid synthesis during
myelination. Lipidomics studies conducted on CMT1A rats and human serum samples [ 26] found that rat sciatic nerves
exhibited impaired sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism in which ceramides, sphingomyelins,
hexosylceramides, and sphingosine were all reduced in CMT1A samples [ 26]. An earlier study also found these
same lipid species to be reduced in CMT1A rat sciatic nerve myelin and also cholesterol, PC, and PG lipid
species [ 25,26]. The two studies tested regimens of lipid supplementation (by either adding lipids or various
components of different lipid biosynthetic pathways) and observed improvements in myelination. A transcriptomic analysis of C3 (CMT1A model) mice found that the most severely down-regulated genes
were those involved in cholesterol biosynthesis [ 27]."

One extensively stud-ied example is myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Although MAG also contains a CRAC motif (Saher and Simons 2010), it most likely does not associate with cho-lesterol. MAG is a member of the noncompact fraction of PNS and CNS myelin. In accordance with its localiza-tion, MAG is not found in detergent-resistant membranes (Erne and others 2002; Saher and others 2009). MAG is a single-span transmembrane glycoprotein with five extra-cellular Ig-like domains that are involved in adhesion of glial cells to axons. MAG supports long-term axon-myelin stability, despite its low abundance (Schnaar and Lopez 2009). Axonal degeneration of MAG null mice is preceded by alterations of the axonal cytoskeleton (Schnaar and Lopez 2009). Especially at the node of Ranvier, the correct distribution of axonal proteins (i.e., adhesion mol-ecules and ion channels) is influenced by MAG. To date, sialoglycans and Nogo receptors have been described as functional receptors for MAG (Kelm and others 1994; McGee and Strittmatter 2003)."

Several of the deregulat -
ed genes (c-Jun , Pou3f1, Id2, Ednrb ) have been shown to inhibit 
myelination and/or myelin gene expression (41, 50–52). The pro -
filing of ASO-treated animals provided further insight into those gene expression changes, such as those observed for Id2  and 
Bzw2 , that are restored upon ASO treatment. Since this group is 
relatively small (<100), this provides important information on treatment-responsive gene expression changes that help normal-
ize Schwann cell function. Future measurement of these genes 
along with PMP22 mRNA in skin biopsies (as done in the foot pad analysis) could provide important biomarkers that can be used in clinical trials. Since overreduction of PMP22 levels could theoreti-cally cause the HNPP neuropathy caused by loss of a PMP22 allele, evaluation of PMP22 mRNA and other biomarkers can be used to monitor for this clinically. Overall, these studies demonstrate the potential therapeutic utility of ASOs in treating CMT1A and eluci-date the gene expression networks that respond to successful res-

gene expression related to cholesterol metabolism ( Figure 2 E). In contrast, during remyelination following chronic demyelin-ation in the cuprizone model, expression of genes involved in

demonstrated that downregulated genes in resistant tumorswere significantly enriched by the targets of immune-associatedtranscription regulators such as IRF8 and SMRT, supporting the
suppression of immune response in resistant tumors ( Fig. 2, C
and D ). Likewise, other immune processes such as IL6 –JAK–STAT3 signaling, IL2 –STAT5 signaling, inflammatory response,
and complement were similarly triggered by short-term treat-ment of AZD8055 but became suppressed during resistance ac-quisition ( Fig. 3 A andFig. S2 C ). Moreover, immune infiltration

predominant in normal nerves, but the balance shifts to negative regulators such as c-Jun,
Notch, Pax-3, Sox2, and Id2 in the injured and pathological nerves. In addition, negative
regulators may be important in the onset and myelination rate during growth (59). The
continued expression of Sox2 and Id2 seems to perform a protective function in neuropathy
since their elimination in P0S63del mice—a CMT1B mouse model—led to an exacerbation

The diverse etiology of mitochondrial neuropathies modeled by
Tfam-SCKO mice is consistent with the notion that the interac-tions of multiple pathological processes ultimately drive diseaseprogression. Therefore, we mined genes differentially expressed
in 2-month-old Tfam-SCKO nerves to search for additional
disease-causing processes. Interestingly, we found that lipid-related metabolic pathways were overrepresented in this set of
genes ( Figure 4 A), suggesting alterations in SC lipid metabolism
secondary to mitochondrial derangements. Indeed, qRT-PCRconﬁrmed that a number of genes that are critically involved in
lipid synthesis were downregulated in Tfam-deﬁcient SCs,
including fatty acid synthase ( Fasn ) and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-
glutaryl-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase ( Hmgcr ;Figure 4 B). More-

The intracellular domain of dystroglycan interacts 
with DRP2 and L-PRX. DG (dystroglycan) conditional KO in Schwann cells display a neuropathic phenotype morpho-logically characterized by irregular folding of myelin, dis-organization of microvilli, and consequent altered clustering of 
 Na+ channels at the node [14]. These features are not 
typical of laminin mutants and their receptors in develop-ment such as β1 integrin, suggesting that this phenotype is not due to altered ECM-Schwann cell communication. One hypothesis is that loss of function of proteins within the DG complex in Schwann cells leads to myelin instability [14]. DRP2 and L-PRX anchor DG in the Schwann cell apposi-tions, which defines the boundaries of the cytoplasm-filled adjacent regions, the Cajal bands (Fig. 1b, d) [13, 15, 17]. Consistent with this, in addition to Cajal bands disruption, loss of either PRX or of DRP2 is associated with myelin abnormalities that share similarities with those observed in the DG mutant.

Finally, other CMT proteins interact with the F-actin cytoskeleton such as PRX (CMT4F) or regulates its assembly, such as FGD4, a GEF for Cdc42 GTPase, which is mutated in the autosomal recessive CMT4H. In conclusion, the generation and characterization of ani -
mal models for these neuropathies as well as the increasing number of IPN genes identified using NGS (next generation sequencing) technologies has enormously contributed to expand and deep our knowledge on myelin biology. In turn, the knowledge of the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms allowed to design and validate at the preclinical level prom-ising therapeutical approaches, which can be potentially translated to human in a near future [129– 133].

[ 1,2](Fig. 1)). These intricate metabolic pathways became
increasingly complicated in the genomic era after the identi ﬁcation of
multiple genes encoding enzymes that seemingly carry out the same
enzymatic reaction. While many of these enzymes are located in the ER,
as expected, the localization and membrane topology of some of the
lipid synthesizing enzymes remain puzzling. Moreover, as many of the
emergent enzymes are identi ﬁed and classi ﬁed by sequence homology,
it is not always clear which lipid substrates they use within the intact
cell. Good examples include the growing family of GPATs (glycero-3-
phosphate acyl transferases), which transfer fatty acyl chains to gly-
cerol-3-phosphate (G3P) as the ﬁrst step in de novo lipid synthesis. GPAT3 and GPAT4 are integral ER-resident membrane proteins,whereas GPAT1 and GPAT2 are localized to the outer mitochondrial
membrane [ 3,4]. Some of these enzymes, such as GPAT4 [ 5], are cri-
tical for triacylglycerol (TG) synthesis and lipid droplet (LD) biogenesiswhile others are involved in controlling phospholipid synthesis."

These hFNSC-derived astrocytes were 
exposed to hypoxia for 48 h which was validated by an increase in the 
expression of the hypoxia-responsive protein, HIF1 α. Transcriptomic 
changes in hypoxia-exposed astrocytes interestingly revealed upregu -
lation of pathways involved in steroid biosynthesis. The upregulated 
genes included key enzymes of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway 
including HMG-coA reductase (HMGCR), mevalonate kinase (MK) and 
squalene epoxidase (SQLE). Cholesterol within the central nervous system is produced de novo, as 
cholesterol from the circulation cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Within the CNS, cholesterol is produced by astrocytes, neurons as well as 
oligodendrocytes with astrocytes serving as a source for cholesterol for 
other cell types during times of need [13]. Cholesterol is transported in 
the form of ApoE-containing lipoproteins. Astrocytes express ABCA1 for 
the efflux of cholesterol and form lipoprotein-like particles which are 
taken up by oligodendrocytes and neurons using LDL-receptor (LDLR), scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SRB1) or LDL-R related protein 1/2 
(LRP1/2) [14]."

extracts from Tr, as well as wild-type, Pmp22 -overexpressing

knockout mice ( Adlkofer et al., 1995, 1997 ). NDRG1 phosphory-
lation was not heavily affected but appeared slightly reduced in Tr
(Fig. 2 C). To determine the cellular distribution of NDRG1 in sciatic
nerve, we immunostained teased fibers from adult rats withNDRG1 antiserum and a mouse monoclonal antibody againstmyelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). NDRG1 colocalized with
MAG in the paranodes, incisures, and the inner mesaxon of
myelin sheaths. NDRG1, but not MAG immunoreactivity, wasseen in the perinuclear region and abaxonal cytoplasm ofmyelinating Schwann cells ( Figs. 3 A and B). To investigate this
further, we examined longitudinal and transverse sections of thesciatic nerve and the nerve roots ( Figs. 3 C and D). In sections,
NDRG1 staining of the outer or abaxonal cytoplasm was more
apparent, in contrast to the MAG staining of the inner oradaxonal Schwann cell membrane."

Cholesterol and APOE4 affect myelination
Oligodendrocytes myelinate the central nervous system and the bio -
availability of cholesterol is rate-limiting for the formation and main-
tenance of myelin29. We reasoned that altered cholesterol localization 
and homeostasis in APOE4 oligodendrocytes may impair myelina -
tion. Compared with APOE3/3 post-mortem human oligodendrocytes, 
APOE3/4 and APOE4/4 post-mortem human oligodendrocytes exhibited 
downregulation of myelin-associated genes (PLLP, MYRF, MAG , OPALIN, 
MOG and PLP1; Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 13). This pattern per -
sisted in cells from individuals without AD pathology, suggesting that 
these myelin-associated genes may be influenced by the APOE genotype 
and not confounded by pathology (Extended Data Fig. 8a and Sup -
plementary Table 13). Decreased myelin-associated gene expression 
occurred concomitantly with increased expression of genes associ -
ated with cholesterol homeostasis, including MVK, FDPS, ABCG1 , IDI1,

The level of NDRG1 mRNA in the brains of myelin-deficient rats
was diminished compared to that of their wild-type littermates, butnot as marked as that of MBP ( Fig. 10 B). As in wild-type rats, all
NDRG1-positive cells in myelin-deficient spinal cords were
colabeled with the oligodendrocyte markers MAG and APC (datanot shown). Discussion
Our results demonstrate that myelinating Schwann cells, but
not sensory or motor neurons, express NDRG1. Thus, protein-
truncating NDRG1 mutations in CMT4D/HMSNL are probablydeleterious to myelinating Schwann cells, thereby causing
demyelination and subsequent axonal degeneration. Similarly, in
the CNS, NDRG1 appears to be solely expressed by oligoden-drocytes so that the loss of NDRG1 expression in oligodendro-

Somewhat surprisingly, of the 2,080 DEGs that are induced in the C22 model, only 43 were found to be induced in

Since ACs can cross the plasma membrane ( Houten and
Wanders, 2010 ) and SCs are intimately associated with axons
in peripheral nerves, we hypothesized that release of ACs fromSCs onto the surrounding axons could alter axonal membrane
properties and ion homeostasis, and contribute to the severe
axon degeneration phenotype in Tfam-SCKO nerves as well asin neuropathies that present with prominent axonal loss. To test this hypothesis, we ﬁrst examined whether long-
chain ACs are released from SCs onto surrounding axons.Two-month-old Ctrl and Tfam-SCKO nerves were cultured asexplants for 2.5 days. At the end of this time, we measured the
amount of long-chain ACs released from the nerves into the
culture media. Whereas Ctrl nerves released very low levels oflong-chain ACs into the surrounding media, Tfam-SCKO nerves
secreted 35-fold more long-chain ACs (primarily C16 and C18;
Figure 6 D). Remarkably, the buildup of long-chain ACs from

. Recent work has demonstrated that apo E secretion and accumulation increase in the regenerating peripheral nerve. The
fact that apoE, in conjunction with apoA-I and LDL receptors, participates in a well-established lipid transfer system raised
the possibility that apoE is also involved in lipid transport in the injured nerve. In the present study of the crushed rat
sciatic nerve, a combination of techniques was used to trace the cellular associations of apoE, apoA-I, and the LDL
receptor during nerve repair and to determine the distribution of lipid at each stage. After a crush injury, as axons died
and Schwann cells reabsorbed myelin, resident and monocyte-derived macrophages produced large quantities of apoE
distal to the injury site."

ced. The down-regulation of myelin protein genes is also 
a feature of the SCAP mutant mice. This adjustment of myelin protein synthesis to the availability of cholesterol presumably saves Schwann cells from toxic effects of membrane protein overexpression. The concerted down-regulation of myelin genes can be transcriptionally con-trolled, as illustrated in the phenotype of mice lacking the relevant transcription factors such as Krox-20 (Topilko and others 1994; Jaegle and others 1996; Le and others 2005).In SQS mutant Schwann cells, P0 is also present in 
membranes of the ER, suggesting a special role of choles-terol in regulated P0 export from the ER into the growing myelin sheath (Fig. 4C). Indeed, the cholesterol-dependent intracellular transport of P0 could be reconstituted in a heterologous cell culture system (SQS mutant fibroblasts)."

Schwann cells express Sox10 at all stages of development 
as early as in migratory neural crest cells before lineage specification, thus suggesting that Sox10 is a key determi-nant of Schwann cell identity [41, 42]. Sox10 is also crucial 
in terminal differentiation and in myelin maintenance, as it controls the expression of several myelin genes encoding P0, MBP, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and Cx32 [33]. Conditional deletion in adult nerves showed that Sox10 
is also required for myelin homeostasis to maintain myelin integrity [43]. In mutant mice lacking Oct6, myelin genes are repressed 
and myelination is blocked [44, 45]. A double Oct6/Brn2  
KO model shows a more severe phenotype as compared to single Oct6 KO, thus suggesting that these factors cooperate 
to promote the transition to a myelinating phenotype. Even if more severe than the single KO, in Oct6/Brn2, double KO myelination is delayed but not completely blocked [46]. This finding led to the hypothesis that another factor such as Brn1 can in part compensate loss of Oct6 in vivo [47]."

results are reported in Supplementary Table 14. Single-cell differential gene expression. Differential gene expression 
between groups of individual cells was estimated using a Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test, as implemented in the R package presto (v.1.0.0; https://
github.com/immunogenomics/presto ). Wilcoxon results are reported 
in Supplementary Table 13. Pseudo-bulk differential gene expression. Individual-level normal -
ized gene expression averages were fitted with the following linear mod -
el: gene expression ≈ β0 × APOE4 + β1 × amyloid + β2 × nft + β3 × age_death + β4 × msex + β5 × pmi. The linear models were fitted using the 
lmfit() function and t -statistics were computed using the eBayes() 
function from the Limma R package (v.3.50.3). Estimates are reported 
in Supplementary Table 15. Pathway analyses

"771of previous literature (Methods). We created a curated database of 
193 brain-expressed and APOE-related pathways comprising 8,759 
unique genes (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Most pathways exhibited 
cell-type-specific activity, yet a subset was active across all major cell types, suggesting the potential for both cell-type-specific and 
broad effects of APOE alterations (Extended Data Fig. 2b)."

NDRG1 mRNA expression is regulated similar to myelin
proteins during nerve development and after nerve injury. A largenumber of myelin-related mRNAs show remarkably similar patterns
of expression, including P0, PMP22, MBP, MAG, Cx32, periaxin,
and Krox20/EGR2 ( Kamholz et al., 2000; Scherer and Salzer, 2001 ). Thus, it is likely that a specific set of transcription factors regulates
these genes in common, including EGR2 and POU-domain tran-
scription factors ( Jaegle et al., 2003; Nagarajan et al., 2001 ). However, at least two genes that cause a demyelinating neuro-
pathy—MTMR2 ( Bolino et al., 2002 ) and LITAF ( Street et al.,
2003 )—do not appear to be regulated in this manner. The phenotype of individuals who have CMT4D includes
subclinical evidence of central conduction slowing ( Kalaydjieva et
al., 1998 ). This finding suggests that oligodendrocytes are also
affected by a loss of NDRG1. In keeping with this possibility, weshow that NDRG1 is localized to the cytoplasm of oligodendro-
cytes, and that NDRG1 mRNA levels are reduced in a dysmyeli-
nating mutant."

The results show that a disease originating in the glial cell disrupts 
the myelin proteome and impacts the axonal proteome to even a 
greater extent. There are almost three times as many differentially 
expressed axonal proteins as myelin proteins (Table 1), and the al-
terations between these axonal proteins show extensive complexity. Among the identified myelin proteins, we found a 4.3- fold highly 
significant (p  < 0.001) decrease in peripheral myelin protein 2 (PMP2) 
(Table 1), a gene that has yet to be examined in PMP22- linked neu-
ropathies. In normal nerves, the PMP2 protein is concentrated 
around densely myelinated axons (Yim et al., 2022), and mutations 
in this cytosolic glial gene cause demyelinating neuropathies (Motley 
et al., 2016). In agreement, cross- sections of sciatic nerves from 
Wt mice display the characteristic mosaic distribution of PMP2-  
positive myelinated axons, identified by immunolabeling for NF- M 
(Figure 4a). Analysis of age- matched P21 TrJ mouse sciatic nerves is 
consistent with the proteomic data and shows an overall reduction 
PMP2- like reactivity around NF- positive axons (Figure 4b)."
