Below is a summary of the evaluation for each user‐provided pathway compared to the ground truth list:

Pathway	               Validation (Hit or no hit)	    Novel or not	      Matched Ground Truth Pathway
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neuronal Development and Axon Guidance	    Hit	             Not Novel	            Axonal Guidance Signaling
Extracellular Matrix Organization and Remodeling	Hit	    Not Novel	            Extracellular matrix organization
Proteolytic Processing and Protein Maturation	  No Hit	            Novel	
Immune Response and Inflammatory Signaling	    No Hit	            Novel	
Transcriptional Regulation and Cell Cycle	        No Hit	            Novel	
Metabolic Regulation	                      No Hit	            Novel	

Interpretative Narrative:
• The “Neuronal Development and Axon Guidance” pathway was validated as a hit through its clear overlap with the ground truth “Axonal Guidance Signaling”. Similarly, “Extracellular Matrix Organization and Remodeling” matches directly with the ground truth “Extracellular matrix organization.” These findings underline that these two user‐provided pathways correspond to well‐established biological processes.

• In contrast, the pathways “Proteolytic Processing and Protein Maturation”, “Immune Response and Inflammatory Signaling”, “Transcriptional Regulation and Cell Cycle”, and “Metabolic Regulation” did not show a direct match in the ground truth list. They therefore are flagged as novel. This could mean that they either represent alternative or broader categorizations of biological processes not explicitly named in the provided ground truth or they may offer a fresh perspective that could merit further investigation to assess their functional coherence and biological relevance.

This evaluation provides a clear overview for follow‐up analysis on whether the novel pathways should be explored further or refined to better align with established pathway terminology.
