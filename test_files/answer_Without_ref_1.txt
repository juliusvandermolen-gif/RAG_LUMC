Aldh1a1 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family Member A1) is involved in retinoic acid biosynthesis. Sqor (Sulfide Quinone Reductase) plays a role in sulfur metabolism.
- **Confidence Level**: High

### 4. **Protein Processing and Modification**
- **Relevant Genes**: **Pcsk5**, **Qsox1**, **Cpe**
- **Significance Explanation**: These genes are involved in protein processing and post-translational modifications. Pcsk5 (Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 5) is involved in the activation of precursor proteins. Qsox1 (Quiescin Sulfhydryl Oxidase 1) is involved in disulfide bond formation. Cpe (Carboxypeptidase E) is crucial for peptide processing.
- **Confidence Level**: High

### 5. **Cellular Structure and Dynamics**
- **Relevant Genes**: **Tuba4a**, **Cobll1**
- **Significance Explanation**: These genes are associated with cellular structure and dynamics. Tuba4a (Tubulin Alpha 4a) is a component of microtubules, essential for cell structure and intracellular transport. Cobll1 (Cordon-Bleu WH2 Repeat Protein Like 1) is involved in actin cytoskeleton organization.
- **Confidence Level**: Medium

### 6. **Reproductive System and Gametogenesis**

- **Confidence Level**: High

### 7. **Immune Response and Regulation**
- **Relevant Genes**: **Marveld1**
- **Significance Explanation**: Marveld1 (MARVEL Domain Containing 1) is implicated in immune response regulation, although its precise role is less characterized.
- **Confidence Level**: Low

### 8. **Potential Novel Pathways**
- **Relevant Genes**: **Zpld1**, **Parm1**, **Sbspon**
- **Significance Explanation**: These genes have less well-characterized roles, suggesting potential novel pathways. Zpld1 (Zona Pellucida Like Domain Containing 1) and Parm1 (Prostate Androgen-Regulated Mucin-Like Protein 1) may be involved in cell adhesion and signaling. Sbspon (Sushi, Von Willebrand Factor Type A, EGF and Pentraxin Domain Containing) could play a role in extracellular interactions.
- **Confidence Level**: Low
