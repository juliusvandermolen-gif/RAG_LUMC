## g:Profiler comparison summary
### Comparison of user-supplied (LLM) pathways with gProfiler ground-truth list  

| Pathway (LLM List) | Validation (Hit/No Hit) | Novel or Common | Matched Pathway (gProfiler List) | Annotation Term (GO/KEGG/REAC) |
|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Semaphorin-Neuropilin-Plexin Signaling | Hit | Common | Axon guidance / cell surface receptor signalling | KEGG:04360 ; GO:0007166 |
| Netrin-Mediated Axon Guidance | Hit | Common | Axon guidance | KEGG:04360 |
| Slit-Robo Signaling | Hit | Common | Axon guidance | KEGG:04360 |
| Non-Canonical Wnt/PCP Signaling | No Hit | Potentially novel / under-represented | – | – |

#### Interpretative summary
• Six of the eight LLM-proposed pathways map convincingly onto terms returned by gProfiler. They converge on themes already highlighted in the ground-truth list—axon guidance (Semaphorin, Netrin, Slit-Robo), myelination, vesicle trafficking, extracellular-matrix remodelling, and broad stimulus-response signalling—reinforcing their biological relevance to neural development and plasticity.  

• “Non-Canonical Wnt/PCP Signaling” was not explicitly retrieved by gProfiler. Although planar-cell-polarity signalling contributes to migration and guidance, it may fall below enrichment thresholds or be split across several generic GO terms (e.g., developmental process, regulation of cell motility) and thus did not appear as a discrete pathway.  

• All validated hits align with well-characterised, canonical processes in the nervous system; no clearly novel pathways absent from the ground-truth list were detected, aside from the possible Wnt/PCP signalling axis noted above.
