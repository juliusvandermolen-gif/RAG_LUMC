It appears that only the ground truth pathways have been provided, and I don’t see a separate list of the pathways you identified (your “found pathways”). In order to generate the requested table comparing your found pathways against the ground truth—and to indicate which ones are confirmed hits, common/household (and thus not novel), or potentially novel—could you please share the list of pathways you obtained in your analysis?
