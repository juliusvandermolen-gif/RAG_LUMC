## g:Profiler Comparison Summary
Here is a comparison of your five proposed pathways against the ground‐truth gProfiler annotations. Loose similarity was used—pathways are called “hits” when they map to related GO/KEGG terms; otherwise they are flagged as novel.

| Pathway (GPT List)                              | Validation | Novel or Common | Matched Pathway                              | Annotation Term    |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling                 | No Hit     | Novel           | –                                             | –                  |
| Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity           | Hit        | Common          | Axon guidance                                 | KEGG:04360         |
| Myelination & Glial Differentiation             | Hit        | Common          | Myelin sheath                                 | GO:0043209         |
| Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport | Hit        | Common          | Regulation of cellular component organization | GO:0051128         |
| Neurogenesis & Neural Development               | Hit        | Common          | Developmental process                         | GO:0032502         |

Summary:
- Four of your five pathways map onto ground-truth terms capturing axon guidance, myelin formation, intracellular organization and broad developmental processes.  
- “Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling” did not appear in the gProfiler output, likely because the enriched annotations focus on general receptor signaling and morphological development rather than synapse-specific plasticity terms.  
- No other novel pathways were detected.

Summary:

- GeneCards GO annotations for all seven genes indicate roles in synaptic processes (transmission, vesicle membrane, plasticity regulation, synapse organization/assembly, cell adhesion), supporting their putative involvement in “Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling.”  
- No directly matching, peer-reviewed articles were identified that explicitly link each gene to the pathway under standard PubMed/Google Scholar searches.  
- This gap suggests that while GO annotations are consistent with synaptic function, further targeted literature review or experimental validation is needed to confirm each gene’s specific role in synaptic plasticity and signaling.

Summary:

- GeneCards GO annotations indicate that all ten genes carry functions related to axon guidance, neuronal projection morphogenesis or related neuronal development processes, supporting a potential role in "Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity".
- Peer-reviewed literature evidence explicitly linking to this pathway was identified for:
  - Ntn1 (1994, Serafini et al., *Cell*)
  - Slit2 (1999, Brose et al., *Cell*)
- No directly matching academic papers were found for Sema4f, Sema3g, Robo2, Srgap1, Plxnb1, Dpysl3, Dpysl5 or Cdh13 under the specified search criteria, indicating gaps in explicit pathway-specific experimental validation.

Summary:
- GeneCards GO annotations show that all seven genes carry terms related to myelin sheath structure and/or glial cell differentiation, consistent with the Myelination & Glial Differentiation pathway.
- Peer-reviewed literature explicitly connecting MPZ to peripheral myelin compaction was identified (Shapiro et al., 1996).
- No directly matching, verified academic publications were found under the specified search criteria for MAG, PMP22, PRX, DRP2, GLDN, or MAL. Further targeted literature review is recommended to confirm their roles in this pathway.

Summary:
- All seven genes carry Gene Ontology annotations in GeneCards consistent with roles in cytoskeletal organization, microtubule‐based processes, actin dynamics, or vesicle‐mediated transport.
- However, targeted searches in PubMed and Google Scholar did not retrieve peer‐reviewed publications explicitly linking these genes by name to the “Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport” pathway under verified titles.
- Thus, while GeneCards supports potential functional involvement, no direct literature evidence was found to confirm these specific gene–pathway associations.

Summary:
- All eleven genes carry Gene Ontology annotations in GeneCards that directly reference aspects of neurogenesis and neural development (e.g., neuron differentiation, neuron development, regulation of neurogenesis).
- Among the set, only MSI1 had a clearly verifiable peer-reviewed publication directly linking its molecular function to neural progenitor cell regulation.
- For the remaining genes (ID2, NES, DYRK1A, ATF5, KLF9, PEG3, IGFBP3, LIFR, CXCL12, NUMB), no single academic paper meeting the strict criteria (exact title match, clear quote) was identified under the specified search constraints.
- This discrepancy highlights a gap between GO-based functional annotations and readily citable literature; further targeted literature review may uncover supporting studies for these genes.
