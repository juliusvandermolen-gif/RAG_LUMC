## g:Profiler Comparison Summary
### Comparison of user-supplied (GPT) pathways with gProfiler “ground-truth” pathways  

| Pathway (GPT List) | Validation (Hit/No Hit) | Novel or Common | Matched Pathway(s) on gProfiler List | Annotation Term (GO/KEGG/REAC) |
|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling | **Hit** | Common | Cell surface receptor signaling pathway; Regulation of signaling | GO:0007166; GO:0023051 |
| Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity | **Hit** | Common | Axon guidance; Axon extension involved in axon guidance | KEGG:04360; GO:0048846 |
| Myelination & Glial Differentiation | **Hit** | Common | Myelin sheath | GO:0043209 |
| Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport | **Hit** | Common | Vesicle; Endomembrane system; Regulation of cellular component organization | GO:0031982; GO:0012505; GO:0051128 |
| Neurogenesis & Neural Development | **Hit** | Common | System development; Developmental process; Neuron projection extension involved in guidance | GO:0048731; GO:0032502; GO:1902284 |

### Interpretative summary
• All five GPT-listed pathways have close functional counterparts in the gProfiler results, so each is considered a **hit**. None appear to be novel with respect to the ground-truth list.

• Biological relevance of the matches  
  – Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling aligns with broad signaling terms captured by gProfiler, underscoring the importance of receptor-mediated communication in neuronal plasticity.  
  – Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity directly overlaps the KEGG “Axon guidance” pathway, a key developmental route steering growing axons to their targets.  
  – Myelination & Glial Differentiation corresponds to the “myelin sheath” GO term, reflecting genes involved in insulating axons and modulating conduction velocity.  
  – Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport map onto vesicle/endosomal and cellular-component-organization terms, core processes driving morphological change and cargo movement along cytoskeletal tracks.  
  – Neurogenesis & Neural Development is encompassed by several development-oriented GO categories in the ground truth, highlighting gene sets directing formation and maturation of neural tissues.

• No user-supplied pathways were absent from the gProfiler list; therefore, no additional novel pathways are proposed beyond the ground truth set.

Summary  
• GeneCards provides GO annotations suggesting possible neuronal or synaptic roles for all seven genes.  
• Verified peer-reviewed literature supporting direct involvement in synaptic plasticity or signaling was found only for MEF2C; no suitably verified papers linking Prss12, Synpr, Sipa1l1, Lrrtm3, Cntn6, or Efna5 to synaptic plasticity & signaling could be located under the stringent evidence criteria used here.  
• Consequently, current combined evidence solidly supports MEF2C in the pathway, whereas the other gene–pathway associations remain unsupported by peer-reviewed literature according to the databases searched.

**Genes involved:** Sema4f, Sema3g, Ntn1, Robo2, Slit2, Srgap1, Plxnb1, Dpysl3, Dpysl5, Cdh13

Summary  
• Robust, mutually supportive evidence (GeneCards GO annotation + peer-reviewed literature) is present for Ntn1 and Slit2, confirming their roles in axon guidance and neuronal connectivity.  
• For Sema4f, Sema3g, Robo2, Srgap1, Plxnb1, Dpysl3, Dpysl5 and Cdh13, GeneCards lists axon-related GO terms, but no verified primary-literature evidence linking these genes specifically to axon guidance or neuronal connectivity could be located using PubMed or Google Scholar under the strict criteria applied here.  
• These gaps highlight areas where additional experimental confirmation or more detailed literature searches may be required to substantiate their proposed involvement in the pathway.

Summary  
• GeneCards GO annotations support a role in myelination for all seven genes.  
• Peer-reviewed literature provides direct, verified evidence for Mpz, Mag, Pmp22, Prx, Gldn, and Mal in myelination or glial differentiation.  
• No peer-reviewed experimental evidence linking Drp2 to this pathway was located under the specified search constraints, indicating a current gap in published support.

### Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport
**Genes involved:** Tuba4a, Tubb4a, Kif1a, Septin4, Septin5, Pfn2, Rab10

Summary  
• GeneCards GO annotations confirm that all seven queried genes possess ontology terms directly linked to cytoskeletal organisation or intracellular transport, aligning them conceptually with the user-specified pathway.  
• Peer-reviewed literature support was located only for KIF1A; the Science article provides clear, experimentally verified evidence of its role in microtubule-based vesicle transport, fully consistent with the pathway definition.  
• No directly verifiable, gene-specific publications were found within PubMed/Google Scholar that unambiguously connect TUBA4A, TUBB4A, SEPTIN4, SEPTIN5, PFN2, or RAB10 to “Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport” using the strict evidence criteria required here.  
• Consequently, while ontological data suggest potential involvement for all genes, solid peer-reviewed experimental confirmation currently supports only KIF1A; additional targeted studies or broader search strategies would be necessary to close the evidence gaps for the remaining genes.

### Neurogenesis & Neural Development
**Genes involved:** Id2, Nes, Dyrk1a, Atf5, Klf9, Msi1, Peg3, Igfbp3, Lifr, Cxcl12, Numb

Summary  
• GeneCards GO annotations support a potential role for all listed genes in neurogenesis or neural development.  
• Verified peer-reviewed literature evidence was located only for NES (nestin); no suitable, verifiable papers explicitly linking the remaining genes to “Neurogenesis & Neural Development” in the requested format were found during the search.  
• Consequently, the gene-pathway association is well supported for NES, while additional primary-literature confirmation is still required for the other ten genes to close the current evidence gap.
