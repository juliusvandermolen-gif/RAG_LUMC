Below is the evaluation of each user‐provided pathway compared to the ground truth pathways. In the table, a “Hit” means that the provided name (or its underlying biological process) directly maps to one or more specific, well‐established pathways in the ground truth. “Not Novel” denotes that the process is already described in the reference list, whereas a “No hit” is flagged as “Novel” (or at least unclassified by the given ground truth) because no specific match was found.

Interpretative Summary:

• The provided “Axon Guidance and Neuronal Development Pathway” was validated against the ground truth by matching it with “Axonal Guidance Signaling,” confirming that key neuronal guidance processes are well represented.

• For extracellular functions, the pathway “Extracellular Matrix and Cell Adhesion Pathway” maps clearly onto two ground truth entries—“Extracellular matrix organization” and “cell adhesion.” This indicates that the user’s description captures common and established extracellular signaling/structural interactions.

• The other user‐provided pathways (e.g., “Growth Factor and Signaling Pathway,” “Immune and Inflammatory Response Pathway,” “Cytoskeletal Dynamics and Vesicle Trafficking Pathway,” “Metabolic Processes and Energy Homeostasis Pathway,” “Cell Stress, Cell Cycle, and Protein Homeostasis Pathway,” and “Miscellaneous/Unclassified”) are all very general in scope. They do not directly correspond to any single, explicitly named ground truth pathway and are thus flagged as “No hit” (and marked as “Novel” in this evaluation). It is possible that these categories represent broad aggregations of multiple specific processes (or potentially underexplored groupings) rather than discrete, well‐characterized pathways.

• Finally, “Protein Processing and Post-translational Modification Pathway” aligns with “Post-translational protein phosphorylation” from the reference, demonstrating relevance to established protein regulatory mechanisms.

In summary, while key processes such as neuronal guidance, extracellular matrix organization, and post-translational modification show clear matches to known pathways, several other categorizations are generic. These may either signal opportunities for more refined classification or suggest potential novel/aggregated pathway groupings that warrant further investigation.
