Base your analysis on prior knowledge available in your training data. After completing your analysis, propose a short descriptive name for the most prominent biological process performed by the system.\n\nConfidence Score Assignment Instruction:\nAfter completing your analysis, please also assign a confidence score to the process name you selected. This score should follow the name in parentheses and range from 0.00 to 1.00. A score of 0.00 indicates the lowest confidence, while 1.00 reflects the highest confidence. This score helps gauge how accurately the chosen name represents the functions and activities within the system of interacting proteins. When determining your score, consider the proportion of genes in the protein system that participate in the identified biological process. For instance, if you select \"Ribosome biogenesis\" as the process name but only a few genes in the system contribute to this process, the score should be lower compared to a scenario where a majority of the genes are involved in \"Ribosome biogenesis\".\n\nFormat Instruction:\nPut your chosen name at the top of the analysis as: Process: <name>.\n\nAnalytical Approach:\n\n- Be concise, do not use unnecessary words.\n- Be factual, do not editorialize.\n- Be specific, avoid overly general statements such as \"the proteins are involved in various cellular processes\".\n- Avoid listing facts about individual proteins. Instead, try to group proteins with similar functions and discuss their interplay, synergistic or antagonistic effects, and functional integration within the system.\n- Avoid choosing generic process names such as \"Cellular Signaling\" and \"Regulation\".\n- If you cannot identify a prominent biological process for the proteins in the system, communicate this in your analysis and name the process: \"System of unrelated proteins\". Provide a score of 0.00 for a \"System of unrelated proteins\".\n\nOne-Shot Example:\nTo help you in your work, I am providing an example system of interacting proteins and the corresponding example analysis output.\n\nExample system of interacting proteins:\nPDX1, SLC2A2, NKX6-1, GLP1, GCG.\n\nExample analysis output:\nProcess: Pancreatic development and glucose homeostasis (0.96)\n\nPDX1 is a homeodomain transcription factor involved in the specification of the early pancreatic epithelium and its subsequent differentiation. It activates the transcription of several genes including insulin, somatostatin, glucokinase, and glucose transporter type 2. It is essential for maintenance of the normal hormone-producing phenotype in the pancreatic beta-cell. In pancreatic acinar cells, it forms a complex with PBX1b and MEIS2b and mediates the activation of the ELA1 enhancer.\n\nNKX6-1 is also a transcription factor involved in the development of pancreatic beta-cells during the secondary transition. Together with NKX2-2 and IRX3, it controls the generation of motor neurons in the neural tube and belongs to the neural progenitor factors induced by Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signals.\n\nGCG and GLP1, respectively glucagon and glucagon-like peptide 1, are involved in glucose metabolism and homeostasis. GCG raises blood glucose levels by promoting gluconeogenesis and is the counter-regulatory hormone of insulin. GLP1 is a potent stimulator of Glucose-Induced Insulin Secretion (GSIS). It plays roles in gastric motility and suppresses blood glucose levels. It promotes growth of the intestinal epithelium and pancreatic islet mass both by islet neogenesis and islet cell proliferation.\n\nSLC2A2, also known as GLUT2, is a facilitative hexose transporter. In hepatocytes, it mediates bi-directional transport of glucose across the plasma membranes, while in the pancreatic beta-cell, it is the main transporter responsible for glucose uptake and part of the cell's glucose-sensing mechanism. It is involved in glucose transport in the small intestine and kidney too.\n\nTo summarize, the genes in this set are involved in the specification, differentiation, growth, and functionality of the pancreas, with a particular emphasis on the pancreatic beta-cell. Particularly, the architecture of the pancreatic islet ensures proper glucose sensing and homeostasis via a number of different hormones and receptors that can elicit both synergistic and antagonistic effects in the pancreas itself and other peripheral tissues.\n\nUser Input:\nHere are the interacting proteins:\nProteins: (protein list)"
