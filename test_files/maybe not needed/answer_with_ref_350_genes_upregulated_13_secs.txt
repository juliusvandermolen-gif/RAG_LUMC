   - **Wnt5a:** Part of the Wnt signaling pathway, which regulates cell fate and movement.

2. **Metabolism and Energy Production:**
   - **Aldh1a1 (Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A1):** Plays a role in retinoic acid biosynthesis, impacting cellular differentiation and metabolism.
   - **Enolase 1 (Eno1) and Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (Pgk1):** Key enzymes in glycolysis, essential for energy production.

3. **Cell Cycle and DNA Repair:**
   - **Msh2 (MutS homolog 2):** Involved in DNA mismatch repair, maintaining genomic stability.
   - **Rad51d (RAD51 paralog D):** Plays a role in homologous recombination and DNA repair.

4. **Immune Response and Inflammation:**
   - **Ifnar1 (Interferon alpha and beta receptor subunit 1):** Part of the interferon signaling pathway, crucial for antiviral responses.
   - **Ccl7 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 7):** Involved in chemokine signaling, mediating immune cell migration.

5. **Structural and Extracellular Matrix Components:**
   - **Hapln1 (Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1):** Contributes to the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix.
   - **Col20a1 (Collagen type XX alpha 1 chain):** Part of the collagen family, important for tissue structure and function.

6. **Protein Modification and Degradation:**
   - **Ube2l3 (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2L 3):** Involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, regulating protein degradation.
   - **Ppp2r5e (Protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B', epsilon):** Modulates protein dephosphorylation, impacting various signaling pathways.

7. **Neuronal Development and Function:**
   - **Cntn6 (Contactin 6):** Plays a role in neural cell adhesion and axon guidance.
   - **Dnm1 (Dynamin 1):** Involved in synaptic vesicle recycling, crucial for neurotransmission.

### Gene-by-Gene Support for Proposed Functions
