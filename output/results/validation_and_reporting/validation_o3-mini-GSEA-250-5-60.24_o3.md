Summary  
• GeneCards GO annotations support a potential role in synaptic plasticity/signaling for all seven genes.  
• Verified academic literature evidence was located only for Mef2c, where a 2008 *Science* paper directly links MEF2C activity to modulation of excitatory synapse number.  
• No peer-reviewed articles explicitly connecting Prss12, Synpr, Sipa1l1, Lrrtm3, Cntn6, or Efna5 to synaptic plasticity/signaling were found under the specified search constraints, indicating a current gap between database annotations and published experimental verification for these genes within this pathway.

Summary  
Most genes (Ntn1, Robo2, Slit2, Srgap1, Plxnb1, Dpysl3, Dpysl5, Cdh13) are strongly supported by both GeneCards GO annotations and peer-reviewed literature for roles in axon guidance or neuronal connectivity. No peer-reviewed evidence was located for Sema4f or Sema3g despite relevant GO annotations; these remain unsupported in the current academic record and represent gaps requiring further investigation.

Summary  
GeneCards GO annotations consistently associate all seven queried genes (Mpz, Mag, Pmp22, Prx, Drp2, Gldn, Mal) with myelin-related biological processes, supporting their potential roles in “Myelination & Glial Differentiation.” However, no peer-reviewed publications with verifiable, exact titles and quotations explicitly confirming each gene’s involvement in this pathway were located in PubMed or Google Scholar using the prescribed search strategy. Consequently, while GeneCards data suggest relevance, direct academic literature evidence remains undocumented here, leaving a gap that warrants further targeted literature review for experimental confirmation.

Summary
• GeneCards GO annotations link all seven genes to processes integral to cytoskeletal organisation or intracellular transport.  
• Peer-reviewed literature provides clear support for Kif1a, Rab10 and Septin5 functioning in these pathways.  
• No verified papers explicitly linking Tuba4a, Tubb4a, Septin4 or Pfn2 to “Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport” were located under the specified search constraints, indicating gaps that require further experimental confirmation or literature discovery.

Summary  
• GeneCards GO annotations consistently associate all listed genes with processes directly relevant to neurogenesis and/or neural development.  
• No peer-reviewed papers meeting the stringent verification criteria could be located for any of the genes; therefore, academic-literature support for these specific gene–pathway links remains unverified within the parameters of this search.  
• Gap: Reliance solely on GeneCards GO terms without corroborating primary literature limits the strength of the evidence.

## g:Profiler comparison summary
### Comparison of LLM-supplied pathways with gProfiler output  

| Pathway (LLM List) | Validation (Hit / No Hit) | Novel or Common | Matched Pathway (gProfiler List) | Annotation Term (GO / KEGG / REAC) |
|--------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling | Hit | Common | Cell-surface receptor signalling pathway / Regulation of signalling / Response to stimulus | GO:0007166, GO:0023051, GO:0050896 |
| Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity | Hit | Common | Axon guidance | KEGG:04360 ; GO:0048846 ; GO:1902284 |
| Myelination & Glial Differentiation | Hit | Common | Myelin sheath | GO:0043209 |
| Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport | Hit | Common | Vesicle / Cytoplasm / Cell motility / Endomembrane system | GO:0031982, GO:0005737, GO:0048870, GO:0012505 |

### Interpretative summary
All five pathways proposed by the user find biologically meaningful counterparts in the gProfiler set:

1. Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling  
   • Captured by broad signalling categories (cell-surface receptor signalling, regulation of signalling, response to stimulus).  
   • Reflects neuronal communication processes present in the gProfiler enrichment.

2. Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity  
   • Direct one-to-one match with the KEGG Axon guidance pathway and related GO terms for axon extension.  
   • Critical for establishing precise neuronal circuits.

3. Myelination & Glial Differentiation  
   • Myelin sheath term indicates enrichment of genes involved in myelin formation; glial differentiation is implicit in this component.  
   • Essential for rapid impulse conduction and white-matter integrity.

4. Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport  
   • Supported by enrichment for vesicles, cytoplasm, endomembrane system, and cell motility—core elements of cytoskeleton-mediated trafficking.  
   • Underpins axonal transport and neuronal morphology.

5. Neurogenesis & Neural Development  
   • Matches multiple broad developmental categories, including system development and specific neuronal developmental GO terms.  
   • Highlights gene involvement in the generation and maturation of neural cells.

No novel pathways (i.e., pathways absent from the gProfiler list) were identified among the LLM suggestions; every proposed pathway aligns—at least loosely—with a gProfiler enrichment term.
