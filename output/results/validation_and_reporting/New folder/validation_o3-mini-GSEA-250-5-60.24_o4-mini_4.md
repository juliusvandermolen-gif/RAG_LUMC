## g:Profiler Comparison Summary
Here is a loose similarity–based validation of your five pathways against the provided ground‐truth list:

| Pathway (GPT List)                         | Validation     | Novel or Common                                     | Matched Pathway (gProfiler List)       | Annotation Term   |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling            | Hit            | Common (synaptic signaling functions captured)      | cell surface receptor signaling pathway | GO:0007166        |
| Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity      | Hit            | Common                                              | Axon guidance                          | KEGG:04360        |
| Myelination & Glial Differentiation        | Hit (partial)  | Common (myelination); novel component (glial differentiation) | myelin sheath                          | GO:0043209        |
| Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport | Hit         | Common                                              | regulation of cellular component organization | GO:0051128 |
| Neurogenesis & Neural Development          | Hit (broad)    | Common                                              | system development                     | GO:0048731        |

Summary  
- All five pathways find at least one representative in the ground truth, so none are wholly “missing.”  
- “Synaptic Plasticity” is subsumed under receptor‐mediated signaling terms rather than a dedicated plasticity GO term.  
- The myelination portion is captured by “myelin sheath,” but “glial differentiation” per se is not in the ground‐truth list—this may represent a novel or underrepresented aspect.  
- Cytoskeletal and transport processes map loosely to general component‐organization terms.  
- Neurogenesis and neural development are covered by broad developmental/process terms (e.g., system or anatomical development).

Summary:
- All seven genes carry GO annotations in GeneCards that relate to synaptic transmission, organization, or plasticity, suggesting potential roles in the “Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling” pathway.
- No peer-reviewed publications were identified under the specified search criteria that explicitly link any of these genes to the pathway in question, indicating a gap between GO-based predictions and directly cited experimental evidence.
- Further in-depth literature review or functional studies may be required to confirm each gene’s direct involvement in synaptic plasticity and signaling.

Summary:
- GeneCards GO annotations support a role in axon guidance for all genes except Cdh13 (which is annotated for homophilic cell adhesion rather than direct guidance).
- Peer-reviewed evidence directly linking to axon guidance and neuronal connectivity was found for Ntn1, Robo2, Slit2, and Plxnb1.
- No explicit primary-research citations were identified for Sema4f, Sema3g, Srgap1, Dpysl3, Dpysl5, or Cdh13 under current search conditions, indicating gaps in the literature or uncharacterized roles in this pathway.

Summary:
- GeneCards GO annotations uniformly support a role in myelination (GO:0042552) and glial cell differentiation (GO:0010001) for all seven genes.
- Peer-reviewed literature clearly links PMP22 and GLDN to peripheral myelination with direct experimental evidence.
- For MPZ, MAG, PRX, DRP2 and MAL, despite strong GO annotation support, we did not identify a single primary research article with a verified exact title explicitly demonstrating their involvement in myelination or glial differentiation under the strict criteria used. These represent current gaps in the explicitly cited literature according to our search.

Summary:
- All seven genes carry GeneCards GO annotations related to cytoskeletal organization or intracellular transport.
- Academic literature evidence explicitly linking the pathway ‘Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport’ was only identified for KIF1A (Okada et al., 1995).
- For TUBA4A, TUBB4A, SEPT4, SEPT5, PFN2, and RAB10, no peer-reviewed articles were found under the strict search criteria, indicating a gap in directly documented associations and suggesting the need for further targeted literature review.

Summary:
- All eleven genes carry Gene Ontology annotations in GeneCards that align with neurogenesis or neural‐development processes.
- Under strict verification criteria—requiring exact, peer‐reviewed publication titles and direct quotations—no academic literature was identified that explicitly links each gene to the “Neurogenesis & Neural Development” pathway.
- This discrepancy highlights a gap between broad GO annotations and concrete, easily citable experimental reports; further targeted literature review may be needed to uncover detailed mechanistic studies.
