(role: system, content: You are a knowledgeable bioinformatics assistant specializing in gene pathway analysis. Your primary objective is to identify and describe functionally significant gene sets using the user’s provided list of genes. Rather than focusing solely on statistical p-values, consider overall biological relevance, functional coherence, and emerging insights. 
When assisting the user, you should:

1. **Input Acceptance and Data Context**:
   - Accept a list of user-provided genes (symbols or identifiers).
   - If additional analysis text or a proposed pathway/function name is provided, carefully review it to understand the rationale behind suggesting a particular function.

2. **Identifying and Interpreting Pathways**:
   - Identify associated biological pathways, both known and novel, based on the provided information and established literature.
   - Go beyond known annotations by integrating broader literature knowledge and biological reasoning.

3. **Structured Presentation of Results**:
   - Organize identified pathways by their functional relevance and biological plausibility.
   - Present each identified pathway along with the list of all associated genes in the following format:
     Pathway Name:
     Gene A, Gene B, Gene C,

    Pathway Name:
    Gene A, Gene B, Gene C
  - Do not include any additional text or explanations beyond the pathway names and associated genes.
4. **Handling Synonyms and Ambiguities**:
   - Treat acronyms or alternative gene names as equivalent if they refer to the same gene.

5. **Final Output and Interpretative Narrative**:
   - Present findings as a clear, concise list of pathways with their corresponding genes, focusing solely on biological relevance and functional coherence.
   - Do not be bound to a set number of pathways.
   - Avoid narrative summaries, explanations, or detailed gene-level discussions beyond the listing of genes.
   - Ensure the list focuses on pathways directly relevant to the user’s query and integrates potential novel or underexplored pathways.
   - Focus particularly on neural genetic-related pathways.

6. **Do Not Critique the User’s Proposed Name or Analysis**:
   - Base evaluations solely on the user’s data and your domain knowledge.
   - Focus on clarity, coherence, and helpfulness in your response.

---

**Additional Guidelines for Presenting Results**:

- Organize identified pathways by grouping genes into coherent functional categories when possible.
- Provide a comprehensive list of all potential pathways that the genes are present in, including a complete list of associated genes (gene symbols only) for each pathway, even if some genes are less relevant.
- Instead of a simple list of genes and their pathways, focus on a small number of biologically meaningful pathways or themes and show how the genes support these themes.

●Compounds preventing axonal degeneration or rescuing altered axo-
nal transport have the potentiality to cure many hereditary neuro -
pathies irrespective of the primary triggering defect: this is the case 
for the inhibitors of SARM1 and of HDAC6, an active field of research. ●Intervention on more specific metabolic pathways is also promising, 
such as for L-Serine to treat HSN1 by reducing neurotoxic deoxy -
sphingolipids, or compounds acting on the PYKfive enzyme in the 
phosphoinositides metabolism in CMT4B, or S-adenosylmethionine 
(SAM) to supply purine nucleotides in CMTX5 and its allelic disorders. ●Mutations in sorbitol dehydrogenase has been very recently asso -
ciated with a relatively common form of CMT2/dHMN and high levels 
of sorbitol. Inhibitors of aldose reductase, developed in the past for 
diabetic neuropathy, are good candidates for its treatment. Table 1. List of CMT genes associated with the different types of CMT and related neuropathies. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and related neuropathies

Schwann cells express Sox10 at all stages of development 
as early as in migratory neural crest cells before lineage specification, thus suggesting that Sox10 is a key determi-nant of Schwann cell identity [41, 42]. Sox10 is also crucial 
in terminal differentiation and in myelin maintenance, as it controls the expression of several myelin genes encoding P0, MBP, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and Cx32 [33]. Conditional deletion in adult nerves showed that Sox10 
is also required for myelin homeostasis to maintain myelin integrity [43]. In mutant mice lacking Oct6, myelin genes are repressed 
and myelination is blocked [44, 45]. A double Oct6/Brn2  
KO model shows a more severe phenotype as compared to single Oct6 KO, thus suggesting that these factors cooperate 
to promote the transition to a myelinating phenotype. Even if more severe than the single KO, in Oct6/Brn2, double KO myelination is delayed but not completely blocked [46]. This finding led to the hypothesis that another factor such as Brn1 can in part compensate loss of Oct6 in vivo [47].

Thus, by analogy with epithelial cell polar -
ity, the abaxonal membrane of myelinated fibers is defined as a basolateral-like region, whereas the adaxonal membrane, SLI, paranodes and microvilli are considered apical-like regions [18, 19]. Schwann Cell Development
During early vertebrate development, neural crest cells delaminate from the neural tube, proliferate, and migrate to generate a broad spectrum of cell types including, among others, Schwann cells, melanocytes, sympathetic neurons, sensory neurons, and skeletal and connective tissues of the head [24– 26]. The cell fate largely depends from the region 
of origin of the neural tube from which neural crest cells migrate. These regions are defined in an anterior–posterior axis direction as cranial, cardiac, vagal, trunk, and sacral. In particular, Schwann cells, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons, sympathetic neurons, and satellite cells associated with sensory neurons, all originate from ventrally migrating trunk neural crest cells [27].

Identification of 
a well- established marker of axonal disease, G3BP1, substantiates 
the notion that irrespective of the cellular origin of the neuropathy, 
the dynamic interplay between the axon and myelinated glia is per-
turbed early- on in affected nerves. This unbiased global proteomic study confirms our previous 
work on the involvement of degradative pathways in PMP22-  
linked neuropathies (Fortun et al., 2003; Notterpek et al., 1997). Since PMP22, the disease- causing protein, is prone to aggregation 
when mutated or overexpressed (Notterpek, Ryan, et al., 1999), 
the mistrafficked protein induces a proteostatic dysbalance (Fortun 
et al., 2003). Dysregulated proteins identified in this study include 
autophagy- related cathepsins B, C, D, and Z, lysosomal- associated 
membrane protein 2, and several other molecules that comprise the 
lysosome and proteasome pathways (Figures 5 and 6 ). Recent ev-
idence suggests that the close regulation of autophagy is directly 
related to the pathobiology of neurodegeneration and is linked 
to the clearance of intracellular waste in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, 
and Huntington's diseases (Song et al., 2021).

Feedback Loops and MicroRNA Regulatio n: 
• MYC expression is tightly regulated by feedback loops and microRNAs. PMP22 may alter 
the expression of specific microRNAs that target MYC, such as  let-7 or miR-34a, 
thereby affecting MYC levels . Experimental Validatio n 
 
To establish a causal relationship, you could:  
• Use Western blottin g or qPC R to measure MYC expression after PMP22 overexpression . • Apply  pharmacological inhibitor s or genetic tools (e.g., CRISPR) to block suspected 
signaling pat hways and observe changes in MYC expression . • Assess the role of ER stress markers (e.g., CHOP, BiP) to link PMP22 overexpression to 
UPR . By understanding these mechanisms, you might 
uncover novel insights into cellular stress, growth, and 
oncogenic tran sformation driven by PMP22 
overexpression.

Below, we summarize currently
described mechanisms by which these regulators contribute to myelin and
myelin lipid homeostasis. PPAR bis a regulator of myelin lipid metabolism
The PPARs comprise a family of three closely related ligand-activated tran-
scription factors, namely PPAR a, PPAR b, and PPAR g.
88,89Lipids, including eicos-
anoids and phospholipids, serve as endogenous ligands for PPARs. Heterodime-
rization with retinoic X receptor (RXR), binding to PPAR-response elements, and
ligand-dependent activation are requisite for PPAR-mediated gene transcrip-
tion.88–90PPARs regulate multiple pathways that contribute to various biological
processes, including mitochondrial homeostasis, adipogenesis, and in ﬂamma-
tion.90–93Within the PPAR family, PPAR bhas been particularly associated with
myelination and myelin homeostasis. PPAR bis abundantly expressed in the
brain, with differential expression in neurons and OLs.94–98PPAR bactivation
in vitro can increase OL sheet deposition, myelin protein expression, and OL dif-
ferentiation.99–101In addition, PPAR bexpression is upregulated in OLs during tis-
sue repair following spinal cord injury.102Interrogating the effects of whole-body
Pparbdeﬁciency using a hypomorphic Pparballele revealed partial hypomyelina-
tion in the corpus callosum, indicating a role for PPAR bin myelination.103More
recently, inactivation of Ppar bin adult OLs was shown to disrupt myelin mainte-
nance in the CNS through dysregulation of fatty acid biosynthesis, ﬁndings which
were replicated when Ppar bwas conditionally depleted in OLs.104Pparband its
heterodimerization partner, Rxr a, interact and functionally cooperate with the KH-
domain RNA-binding protein QKI, which is necessary for the transcriptional acti-
vation of fatty acid biosynthesis genes ( Figure 3 F).

Because neuronal upregulation of genes related to choles-
terol metabolism could be a general response to chronic myelinalterations, we analyzed transcriptional proﬁles of isolated
cortical neurons following acute experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) induction and following acute-phase(6 weeks of cuprizone) and chronic-phase remyelination
(12 weeks of cuprizone followed by 2 weeks of cuprizone with-
drawal, 12+2 weeks) ( Figure 2 D). During acute disease (EAE or
6 weeks of cuprizone), neurons consistently downregulated
gene expression related to cholesterol metabolism ( Figure 2 E). In contrast, during remyelination following chronic demyelin-ation in the cuprizone model, expression of genes involved in
cholesterol metabolism was increased ( Figure 2 E;Table S3 ). To test whether the upregulation of cholesterol synthesis geneswas functionally relevant, we determined the abundance of ste-rols by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry
(GC/MS) in the chronic remyelination paradigm.

CMT1A iPSC-SCPs show transcriptomic changes 
related to an abnormal lipid metabolism
To investigate the effects of PMP22 duplication in the context of 
CMT1A using a human-derived model, we used a protocol adapted

(iPSC-SCPs) (Fig.

In both cases, a single, continuous basal lamina covers 
these neuron-satellite glia units, which are separated from each other by 
connective tissue (Pannese, 2010 ). During development, SGCs are 
derived from neural crest cells and likely furthermore originate from 
boundary cap cells (Jessen and Mirsky, 2005 ; Marol et al., 2004 ). As 
SGCs share several similarities with SC precursor cells, they have been 
suggested to represent a population of developmentally arrested SCs 
(George et al., 2018 ). Though, other studies demonstrate a molecular 
profile more reminiscent to astrocytes (Avraham et al., 2020 ; Jager 
et al., 2020 ; van Weperen et al., 2021 ) and emphasize overlapping 
functions to astrocytes in the CNS (Hanani and Spray, 2020 ; Huang 
et al., 2013 ). However, satellite glial cells were shown to also express 
unique genes that are absent in SCs and astrocytes (Mapps et al., 2022 ). Recent RNA-sequencing studies identified a pronounced M. Bosch-Queralt et al. Neurobiology of Disease 176 (2023) 105952

These findings were consistent with the motor behavior and electrophysiology charac-terizations of the C22 cohort described in Figure 1. This was, to our knowledge, the first RNA-seq profiling of 
a CMT1A model, and the analysis showed some categories of 
genes in common with microarray profiles of other CMT1A mod-
els (34, 37 , 38). For example, there was a significant decrease in cholesterol and lipid biosynthetic genes as well as myelin-related genes in 5-week-old C22 compared with WT littermates (Supple -
mental Figure 2, C and F). The increased gene categories include a number involved in cell signaling, as well as those involved in axon guidance mechanisms (RhoA , Plxna1, and Rac1 ) and inte -
grin signaling (Itgb8 ) (Supplemental Figure 2D). Expression of 
myelin inhibitors such as Id2 , Id4, and Ednrb  was also increased, 
suggesting an unfavorable environment for remyelination (Sup -
plemental Figure 2E). Dysregulation of several transcription fac-tors regulating Schwann cell differentiation was also observed in the C22 mice (Supplemental Figure 2F).

Approximately 30 diseases are related to the differentially expressed 
protein groups of the neuropathic nerves. These diseases range be-
tween the groupings of endocrine and nutritional, congenital and 
chromosomal abnormalities, and nervous system diseases (Figure  8a). We chose to focus on nervous system disorders due to their rele-
vance to the current study. Neurological diseases identified include 
illnesses of the myoneural junction and muscle, systemic atrophies of 
the CNS, episodic and paroxysmal disorders, and polyneuropathies of the PNS (Figure  8b). Figure  8c depicts the top six neural disorders 
(A- F), which share overlapping protein perturbations with the neuro-
pathic nerves, and the specific proteins corresponding to the disease 
are represented in the chord diagram. As expected, CMT is the most 
enriched nervous system disease, while there are parallels with other 
illnesses as well. For example, TrJ mouse nerves display abnormal ac-
cumulation of cellular products in the cytoplasm (Fortun et al., 2003; 
Zhou et al., 2020), similar to neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, which 
represents a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by 
undegraded lysosomal cargo (Nita et al., 2016).

A consistent slow NCV of < 38 m/s in the
arms represents the demyelinating form of CMT1, whereas a value >38 m/s is distinctive
of the axonal form of CMT2. Transitional NCVs (25–45 m/s) are often observed in males
with CMTX1 and in patients with other transitional patterns of CMT [4]. The genetic diagnosis of CMT has been conducted by implementing the targeted next-
generation sequencing and whole-exome sequencing approaches. Over 120 gene mutations
are related to the pathogenesis of CMT and associated neuropathies [ 5,6]. The frequency of
the various types of CMT varies by region and the age at which they were published. In
the study by Saporta et al., 787 out of 1024 patients were diagnosed with CMT; a genetic
subtype was identiﬁed in 527 (67%) of these patients, while the remaining 260 patients did
not present with any identiﬁable mutation. Among the genetically deﬁned cases, CMT1A
(PMP22 ) emerged as the most prevalent subtype, comprising 55% of the cases, followed
by CMTX1 ( GJB1 ; 15.2%), hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP;

Next, we asked whether the disease biomarkers identified in 
the C22 transcriptomic study can be confirmed in the CMT1A rat 
model. Consistent with findings in C22 mice, the mRNA levels of lipid biosynthetic genes such as Sc5d and Ugt8a were decreased in CMT1A rats, although to a lesser extent than in C22 mouse nerves. ASO6 treatment trended toward increased mRNA levels of these genes (Figure 3G). Furthermore, the mRNA levels of Id2  
and Bzw2  were significantly increased in CMT1A rats compared 
with WT rats and were substantially decreased following ASO6 treatment (Figure 3G). Finally, we sought to identify a target engagement biomarker 
in the CMT1A rats. Toward this end, we collected blood and foot -
pad skin biopsies from treated CMT1A rats. Although there was detectable rat Pmp22 mRNA in the blood, there was no change in Pmp22 levels following ASO6 treatment (Supplemental Fig -
ure 5E). The level of rat Pmp22 mRNA in the footpad (containing dermal nerves and Schwann cells) was significantly reduced in ASO6- compared with control-treated rats, suggesting this could serve as a biomarker of target engagement (Figure 3H).

Schwann cells (iPSC-SCs) (Fig. 3A) from a patient line, CS67i-CMT-n1, alongside its isogenic control iPSC line, isogenic-CS67i-CMT (referred to as ‘CMT1A’ and ‘isogenic’ lines, respectively) (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5
). The isogenic line contained one copy of PMP22 less, in com -
parison to its CMT1A mutant counterpart ( Supplementary Fig. 6).During differentiation, the iPSC colonies acquired a Schwann cell- 
like morphology, accompanied by the expression of key proteins 
marking the transitions from iPSCs to early neural crest cells, SCPs and, ultimately, Schwann cells (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Figs 2 
and 3). Moreover, we documented the temporal expression profile of 
genes essential to Schwann cell lineage development (Fig. 3C). We 
also observed that these iPSC-SCs were capable of producing myelin when co-cultured with mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons (Fig. 3D). Bulk RNA-seq indicated that the transcriptome of CMT1A and 
isogenic iPSC-SCPs was similar to that of neural crest progenitors 
(Fig.

In the outbred rat model of CMT1A,22rats can have varying 
levels of rodent Pmp22 expression, giving rise to a spectrum of pheno -
type severities, including variations in the expression of lipid 
metabolism-related genes.22,49To understand how these transcrip -
tional changes influence the CMT1A lipid profiles, we performed lipi-
domics on the sciatic nerves of 5-week-old C3 mice. Overall, the 
analysis revealed a major downregulation of lipid species in general, 
particularly of SPs, with SMs being the most affected in the sciatic 
nerves of C3 mice compared with their age-matched littermate con-
trols. In further support of these alterations, CMT1A rat sciatic nerve 
myelin exhibited significantly reduced levels of total cholesterol, PC, 
PE, plasmalogens, SM and ceramides.49
The correct PM lipid composition is essential for Schwann cells to 
interact with axons and to produce myelin, the multilamellar lipid- 
based structure. During Schwann cell lineage development, neural 
crest cells give rise to SCPs, which are guided to the most distal regions 
of the body by the extending peripheral axons.51Once interacting with 
axons, SCPs can differentiate into immature Schwann cells, which or-
ganize axons to be myelinated and non-myelinated in a process de-
fined as radial sorting.52To investigate the cellular origins of CMT1A 
lipid alterations, we developed a protocol to derive a Schwann cell lin-
eage from iPSCs.

Indeed, we are still with -
out any drug treatment for CMT and there is no major impact 
on real world coming from ongoing research, yet. Which are the reasons for the gap with the other neuro -
muscular disorders? There are several contributing factors. The 
peripheral nerves are intrinsically more difficult to study as 
compared to the muscles and even to the motor neurons: it is 
problematic to obtain nerve tissue to be studied and charac -
terized, Schwann cells and myelination studies are particularly 
challenging, and it is currently extremely hard if not impossi -
ble to obtain reliable Schwann cells from iPSCs. It is also 
arduous to target drugs and gene therapies to the peripheral 
nerves, particularly to correct Schwann cell defects. Other 
reasons are constituted by: the great genetic heterogeneity 
of this group of diseases, with about 100 genes and loci 
involved in CMT and related neuropathies; the great variability 
of disease expression, with different phenotype severity 708

Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) accounts for more than 95% of the 
disease, with approximately 50 million cases worldwide. The heritability 
of AD is estimated to be between 50% and 80%, suggesting that genet-
ics is the most dominant risk factor after age. Genome-wide associa -
tion studies have identified genetic variants that are associated with 
an increased risk of AD1. The E4 allele variant of the APOE gene (APOE4) 
shows the strongest association with AD1–3. One copy of the APOE4 allele, 
which differs from the major allele (APOE3) by a single amino acid change 
from Cys112 to Arg112, increases the risk of developing AD three- to 
fourfold, whereas two copies increase the risk by eight- to twelvefold2. APOE4 is associated with increased amyloid-β deposition, hyperphos -
phorylation and aggregation of tau, and accelerated cognitive decline4–7. However, the mechanisms by which APOE4 mediates these effects are not fully understood. The APOE4 allele is present in 40–50% of indi -
viduals with AD8; thus, elucidating the molecular and cellular pathways 
that underlie APOE4-associated pathogenesis could reveal therapeutic 
opportunities for a large portion of the AD population.

We identify a number of strategies to reduce pTau in a
CE-dependent manner and ﬁnd that allosteric activation ofCYP46A1 is a neuron-speciﬁc CE-lowering strategy particularly

neurons, we screened a collection of 1,684 approved and
preclinical drugs for their efﬁcacy to lower neuronal pThr231Tau. For our screen, neural progenitor cells (NPCs; line APPdp1-6)
(Israel et al., 2012 ) were differentiated to neurons ( Figures S1 A

These hFNSC-derived astrocytes were 
exposed to hypoxia for 48 h which was validated by an increase in the 
expression of the hypoxia-responsive protein, HIF1 α. Transcriptomic 
changes in hypoxia-exposed astrocytes interestingly revealed upregu -
lation of pathways involved in steroid biosynthesis. The upregulated 
genes included key enzymes of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway 
including HMG-coA reductase (HMGCR), mevalonate kinase (MK) and 
squalene epoxidase (SQLE). Cholesterol within the central nervous system is produced de novo, as 
cholesterol from the circulation cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Within the CNS, cholesterol is produced by astrocytes, neurons as well as 
oligodendrocytes with astrocytes serving as a source for cholesterol for 
other cell types during times of need [13]. Cholesterol is transported in 
the form of ApoE-containing lipoproteins. Astrocytes express ABCA1 for 
the efflux of cholesterol and form lipoprotein-like particles which are 
taken up by oligodendrocytes and neurons using LDL-receptor (LDLR), scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SRB1) or LDL-R related protein 1/2 
(LRP1/2) [14].

Nonetheless, there is still no pharmacological treatment 
available for any CMT type. However, the landscape is rapidly evolving and several novel approaches 
are providing encouraging results in preclinical studies and leading to clinical trials. Areas covered : The authors review the most promising therapies under study and the ongoing/ 
planned clinical trials. Several approaches to address PMP22 overexpression underlying CMT1A, the 
most frequent subtype, are being tested. Gene silencing, targeting PMP22, and gene therapy, to 
introduce specific genes or to substitute or modulate defective ones, are being experimented in animal 
models. Compounds acting on ER stress, unfolded protein response, neuregulin pathways, phosphoi -
nositides metabolism, axonal transport and degeneration, inflammation, polyol pathway, deoxysphin -
golipid metabolism, purine nucleotide pool are potential therapeutic candidates for different forms of 
CMT and related neuropathies. Expert opinion : We are getting closer to find effective therapies for CMT, but are far behind the 
exciting examples of other genetic neuromuscular disorders.

OPCs; T cell receptor and cytokine signalling in astrocytes; and 
tumour-necrosis-factor-mediated signalling in microglia and excitatory

occurred in neurons (for example, voltage-gated calcium channel activ -
ity), but also in oligodendrocytes (for example, long-term neuronal

endosomal-related transport (such as RAB21  and SNX12) genes (Sup -

oligodendrocyte differentiation [4]. Astrocyte activation in response to 
CNS injury can have both protective and detrimental effects on overall 
neuronal survival and myelination [5]. In this study, we aimed to study 
the effect of hypoxia on astrocytes to delineate the pathways that could 
potentially impact oligodendrocyte maturation. Transcriptomic analysis of human fetal neural stem cell-derived as-
trocytes subjected to hypoxia demonstrated the upregulation of 
cholesterol biosynthetic pathways. These findings were validated by 
measuring the gene and protein expression of cholesterol synthetic and 
transport proteins in FNSC-derived astrocytes and in a cell line model. Astrocyte cholesterol content and efflux was also increased in response 
to hypoxia. However, premyelinating oligodendrocytes did not

This suggests that MYC-
driven tumors are likely intrinsically resistant to mTOR block-
ade. Across human cancer, MYC is frequently amplified and
MYC can mitigate antitumor effects of many cancer therapeutics(Fallah et al., 2017 ). This stresses the need to identify the
Achilles ’heel(s) of MYC-driven cancers. Targeting MYC itself
has remained challenging, partly because of the lack of an en-zymatic pocket and the predominant nuclear localization of theprotein, both of which make the use of small molecule inhibitorsor blocking antibodies cumbersome ( Wang et al., 2021 ). How-
ever, recent cancer dependency map studies utilizing CRISPR/
Cas9 and small hairpin RNA –based genetic screens may repre-
sent valuable resources to identify novel therapeutic opportu-nities to target MYC-dependent cancer cells ( Tsherniak et al.,
2017;Meyers et al., 2017 ). At present, targeted therapies of the PI3K –AKT –mTOR
pathway are not first-line in breast cancer. Instead, these ther-apeutics have been used in ER+/HER2 −postmenopausal breast
cancer patients who are refractory to endocrine therapies —
acquired genetic alterations activating the PI3K –AKT –mTOR
pathway frequently drive resistance to endocrine therapies(Nunnery and Mayer, 2020 ).

colorectal cancer, polymorphisms inROCKs were found tobeclosely

hasalsobeen detected inhepatocellular carcinoma [15].However, the
mechanism bywhich ROCK1 plays aroleinregulating tumor glucose

master regulators ofmetabolic reprogramming invarious cancer types,
including pancreatic cancer [16].Studies have shown that c-MYC can
participate intheregulation oftumor cellgrowth, cellcycle progression,

MYC alone does notseem tobethedecisive factor incancer. Instead, c-
MYC must exert synergistic orantagonistic effects onother oncogenes

phosphorylation ofc-MYC atcertain sites governs itsactivation and
subsequent biological functions through thetranscriptional activation of
target genes thatarenecessary forcellgrowth, anditsphosphorylation

have revealed that ROCK1 plays acrucial role inregulating prostate
tumor growth through aninteraction with c-MYC [19,20].Therefore,

2 and 3 ). Although this pathway 
has not been fully dissected in our work, the available data are consistent with the idea that the establishment of cell-to-cell contacts engages both transcriptional and a post-transcriptional mechanisms that counterbalance the action of c-Myc (Fig. 3) . The transcriptional mechanisms 
restore normal integrin subunit mRNA expression levels whereas the post-tran -
scriptional routes impact on the stability of Pak1 protein ( Fig. 3) . Regardless of the 
mechanisms involved, it is worth noting that the biological program activated by cell-to-cell contacts is not related to the stimulation of contact inhibition path -
ways, because RhoA

cells are highly transformed and have lost completely that type of regulation. 19
Although the data presented in this 
Extra View article formally demonstrated the role of Pak1 and integrin subunits in the c-Myc-dependent biological program, the readers should keep in mind that many more proteins could be implicated in this process.

To obtain better insights into the under -
lying pathogenic mechanisms in CMT1A, we investigated the role of PMP22 duplication in cellular homeostasis in 
CMT1A mouse models and in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated into Schwann cell precur -
sors (iPSC-SCPs). We performed lipidomic profiling and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on sciatic nerves of two developing CMT1A 
mouse models and on CMT1A patient-derived iPSC-SCPs. For the sciatic nerves of the CMT1A mice, cholesterol 
and lipid metabolism was downregulated in a dose-dependent manner throughout development. For the CMT1A 
iPSC-SCPs, transcriptional analysis unveiled a strong suppression of genes related to autophagy and lipid metabol -
ism. Gene ontology enrichment analysis identified disturbances in pathways related to plasma membrane compo -
nents and cell receptor signalling. Lipidomic analysis confirmed the severe dysregulation in plasma membrane 
lipids, particularly sphingolipids, in CMT1A iPSC-SCPs. Furthermore, we identified reduced lipid raft dynamics, dis -
turbed plasma membrane fluidity and impaired cholesterol incorporation and storage, all of which could result from 
altered lipid storage homeostasis in the patient-derived CMT1A iPSC-SCPs.

CMT1A line in comparison to its isogenic iPSC-SCPs (Fig. 4A). Gene 
ontology (GO) enrichment analysis identified the PM component 
(GO component), receptor signalling and activity (GO function) 
and cell adhesion (GO process) as the core pathways enriched in 
CMT1A iPSC-SCPs (Fig. 4B). These data indicate early transcription -
al dysregulation in the CMT1A iPSC-SCPs, altering the transcrip -
tional networks of essential pathways for Schwann cell 
development, differentiation and maturation. To understand how alterations in the transcriptome translate to 
lipid profiles in CMT1A, we performed a detailed lipidomic analysis 
on CMT1A and isogenic iPSC-SCPs. The PCA score plot, based on the 
measured lipid concentrations, showed a clear difference between 
CMT1A and isogenic iPSC-SCPs (Fig. 4C). Specifically, CMT1A 
iPSC-SCPs exhibited significantly lower levels of SM compared 
with the isogenic controls. Furthermore, CMT1A iPSC-SCPs had 
lower levels of Cer, HexCer and Dh-Cer but, in most cases, without 
reaching statistical significance.

It is also reasonable that modulating Nrg1-III 
activity may constitute a general therapeutic strategy to treat 
CMT that are characterized by de/dysmyelination. Recently 
genetic overexpression of Nrg1-III has been shown to ameliorate 
the neurophysiological and morphological parameters in 
a mouse model of CMT1B and stimulating Nrg1-III signaling by 
pharmacological suppression of the Nrg1-III inhibitor TACE also 
ameliorated the neuropathy [46]. The importance of the neur -
egulin pathway is confirmed by the notable finding that soluble 
Neuregulin1 type I promoted myelin repair after nerve injury 
and its administration to CMT1A rats improved their motor 
performance, increased the number of myelinated axons in 
sciatic nerves, and restored the reduced axonal caliber [47]. 2.8. CMT4B: other approaches
CMT4B1 and CMT4B2 are caused by loss-of-function mutations 
in the myotubularin-related 2 (MTMR2, CMT4B1) and MTMR13 
(also known as SBF2, SET binding factor 2, CMT4B2) genes, 
involved in the phosphoinositides (PIs) metabolism [48].

High-abundance cell types were 
well represented across all of the donors, independent of AD diagnosis 
or genotypic background, with reproducible proportions in most cases 
(Extended Data Fig. 1l,m). Thus, downstream analysis focused on only 
high-abundance cell types. APOE4 pathway-level alterations
To broadly characterize the potential transcriptomic effects of APOE4 
on molecular processes, we considered Gene Ontology biological 
processes and performed differential pathway activity analysis. We 
aggregated gene expression values into pathway activity scores and 
estimated the effect of APOE4 on aggregate scores. Activity scores 
summarize the overall gene expression levels for genes in a given path -
way, improving the power to detect subtle changes in pathway activity 
(Methods). We compared APOE3/4 and APOE4/4 versus APOE3/3 scores 
using a multivariate linear model controlling for sex, PMI, amyloid, 
neurofibrillary tangles and age at death. A total of 486 candidate APOE4-perturbed molecular processes were identified (P  < 0.05), 
including cell-type-specific (404 pathways, affected only in one cell 
type) and broadly dysregulated (82 pathways, affected in at least two cell types) processes (Fig.

Instead, this study found that MCT1 is 
needed by macrophages for optimal nerve repair (Jha et al., 2021 ). 3.5. Remyelination 
SCs eventually enwrap successfully regrown axons with a new 
myelin sheath. However, remyelinated internodes remain thinner and 
significantly shorter compared to developmental myelination, leading to 
an incomplete restoration of nerve function after injury (Schroder, 
1972 ). In order to complete remyelination, SCs need to redifferentiate 
into myelinating SCs, which is associated with a downregulation of 
repair SC genes and a concomitant induction of the genes responsible for 
SC differentiation and myelin synthesis (Fazal et al., 2017 ; Jessen and 
Mirsky, 2019a, 2022 ; Kim et al., 2018 ). Although many factors and 
signalling pathways implicated in developmental myelination also 
contribute to remyelination after peripheral nerve injury, the latter is 
not a simple recapitulation of peripheral nerve development (Chen et al., 
2007 ; Jessen and Mirsky, 2019a ).

In the cortex, con-
ditional inactivation of cholesterol synthesis in neurons or oligo-dendrocytes resulted in moderate upregulation of cholesterol
synthesis genes, possibly to compensate for the loss of choles-
terol synthesis in the affected cell type ( Figure 1 E;Table S2 ). In
contrast, in all conditional mutants, we observed a moderatebut consistent downregulation of expression related to choles-
terol metabolism in white matter ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and S1
H). Here, reduced expression of genes associated with cholesteroltransport was noted in all conditional mutants, particularly in
AcKO animals ( Figure 1 F). In agreement, sterol proﬁling revealed
only moderate alteration in conditional mutants ( Figure S2 A). Surprisingly, corpus callosum of OLcKO and NcKO mice re-
vealed a marked downregulation of genes related to the blood-
brain barrier (BBB). This was accompanied by upregulation ofa few inﬂammatory mediators with proﬁles being unique toeach mutant ( Figures 1 E and 1F). Interestingly, by biochemical
quantiﬁcation of BBB permeability, the reduced tight junction
gene expression was paralleled by increased CNS inﬂux of thesmall-molecular-weight BBB tracer sodium ﬂuorescein (NaFl;
376 Da) in OLcKO and NcKO brains.

[25]. mRNA expression of both lipid catabolizing and anabolizing transcripts were affected. This study further
showed that during development, lipid metabolism genes (including those of sterol metabolism) failed to
up-regulate in a CMT1A background compared with WT, suggesting a failure to engage lipid synthesis during
myelination. Lipidomics studies conducted on CMT1A rats and human serum samples [ 26] found that rat sciatic nerves
exhibited impaired sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism in which ceramides, sphingomyelins,
hexosylceramides, and sphingosine were all reduced in CMT1A samples [ 26]. An earlier study also found these
same lipid species to be reduced in CMT1A rat sciatic nerve myelin and also cholesterol, PC, and PG lipid
species [ 25,26]. The two studies tested regimens of lipid supplementation (by either adding lipids or various
components of different lipid biosynthetic pathways) and observed improvements in myelination. A transcriptomic analysis of C3 (CMT1A model) mice found that the most severely down-regulated genes
were those involved in cholesterol biosynthesis [ 27].

described mechanisms by which these regulators contribute to myelin and
myelin lipid homeostasis. PPAR bis a regulator of myelin lipid metabolism
The PPARs comprise a family of three closely related ligand-activated tran-
scription factors, namely PPAR a, PPAR b, and PPAR g.
88,89Lipids, including eicos-
anoids and phospholipids, serve as endogenous ligands for PPARs. Heterodime-
rization with retinoic X receptor (RXR), binding to PPAR-response elements, and
ligand-dependent activation are requisite for PPAR-mediated gene transcrip-
tion.88–90PPARs regulate multiple pathways that contribute to various biological
processes, including mitochondrial homeostasis, adipogenesis, and in ﬂamma-
tion.90–93Within the PPAR family, PPAR bhas been particularly associated with
myelination and myelin homeostasis. PPAR bis abundantly expressed in the
brain, with differential expression in neurons and OLs.94–98PPAR bactivation
in vitro can increase OL sheet deposition, myelin protein expression, and OL dif-
ferentiation.99–101In addition, PPAR bexpression is upregulated in OLs during tis-
sue repair following spinal cord injury.102Interrogating the effects of whole-body
Pparbdeﬁciency using a hypomorphic Pparballele revealed partial hypomyelina-
tion in the corpus callosum, indicating a role for PPAR bin myelination.103More
recently, inactivation of Ppar bin adult OLs was shown to disrupt myelin mainte-
nance in the CNS through dysregulation of fatty acid biosynthesis, ﬁndings which
were replicated when Ppar bwas conditionally depleted in OLs.104Pparband its
heterodimerization partner, Rxr a, interact and functionally cooperate with the KH-
domain RNA-binding protein QKI, which is necessary for the transcriptional acti-
vation of fatty acid biosynthesis genes ( Figure 3 F).

total population. Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampliﬁcation
revealed that duplications (56.7%) or deletions (21.9%) in PMP22 were reported for most of
the positive results; next, mutations were detected in GJB1 (6.7%), MPZ (5.3%), and MFN2
(4.3%). GJB1 deletions and mutations in the residual genes were 5.3% of the anomalies. Of
the individuals presenting a positive genetic outcome in a CMT-related gene, 94.9% had a
mutation in one of the following four genes ( PMP22 ,GJB1 ,MPZ , orMFN2 ) [8]. Effective pharmacological treatments for CMT are currently lacking. This review dis-
cusses the treatment of CMT with the four main causative genes.

Abstract
Myelin is a key evolutionary specialization and adaptation of vertebrates formed by the plasma membrane of glial cells, which insulate axons in the nervous system. Myelination not only allows rapid and efficient transmission of electric impulses in the axon by decreasing capacitance and increasing resistance but also influences axonal metabolism and the plasticity of neural circuits. In this review, we will focus on Schwann cells, the glial cells which form myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we will describe the main extrinsic and intrinsic signals inducing Schwann cell differentiation and myelination and how myelin biogenesis is achieved. Finally, we will also discuss how the study of human disorders in which molecules and pathways relevant for myelination are altered has enormously contributed to the current knowledge on myelin biology.

Approximately 350 GO terms corresponding 
to biological processes, ~130 terms representing cellular components, 
and ~70 denoting molecular functions demonstrated significant enrich-
ment from the differentially expressed protein pool (not shown). Of 
the top ten enriched biological processes, four are related to RNA me-
tabolism, three to dopamine processing, and two are involved in axon 
development. One in macromolecule catabolic processing (Figure 2c). Enriched cellular components reflect the axonal changes within the sci-
atic nerves of neuropathic mice, with five out of the top ten GO terms 
correlating with nerve axon- related cellular components (Figure 2d). Additionally, nine of the top ten molecular functions enriched within 
the affected samples are associated with RNA and nucleic acid activi-
ties (Figure 2e). Based on these analyses, we further examined enriched myelin and axonal gene products (Figures 3 and 4 ), as well as the top 
three augmented protein networks, namely the proteasome, lysosome, 
and spliceosome pathways (Figure 5–7).

HME cells, we next wanted to identify novel targets that might
contribute to the activation of FAO in MYC HME cells. Since MYC is
a transcription factor, we performed NextGen RNA sequencing onTERT, MYC, and HER2 HME cells to gain further insight into
potential mechanisms of how MYC affects FAO in HME cells

Differential pathway activity analysis. To minimize the discovery 
of false positive effects, activity scores were computed only after fil -
tering out genes that were not expressed in a given cell type (defined 
as a nonzero detection rate ≥10%, see Supplementary Table 2 for a 
full list of expressed genes per cell type). For each pathway-cell type 
combination, pathway activity scores were modelled using a multivari -
ate linear model as follows: pathway activity ~β0 × APOE4 + β1 × amy -
loid + β2 × nft + β3 × age_death + β4 × msex + β5 × pmi. Here, APOE4 is a 
binary variable, encoding the presence of at least one E4 allele. Amyloid 
and nft are averages of continuous measurements of pathology across 8 
and 5 brain regions, respectively, as evaluated and reported by ROSMAP. Age_death is a continuous measurement indicating age at death, pmi 
represents the PMI (a continuous measurement) and sex is a binary 
variable encoding biological sex. β0 represents the additive effect 
of APOE4 (≥1 allele) on pathway activity, when accounting for other confounding variables that might be correlated with, and therefore 
explain, a portion of the variation observed in the activity of a pathway 
of interest.

However, while high-fat diet can partially compensate for a deﬁciency in fatty
acid synthesis in the CNS, in the PNS a high fat diet results in worsening of myelin defects when fatty
acid synthesis is impaired [ 110,111]. The mechanisms underlying di erential e ects in the CNS vs.
PNS remain to be determined. Taken together the current literature suggests that the uptake of fatty
acid may not be the primary pathway for myelin formation. However, the importance of fatty acid
uptake contributing to the energetic metabolism of myelinating cells and axonal trophic support is
still unclear. Finally, there is also new evidence that lipids could be provided to myelin cells by neurons. A recent study found that fatty acids are released by hyperactive neurons and can be taken up by
neighboring glia to protect neurons from fatty acid toxicity [158]. 11. Fatty Acid Oxidation
The nervous system has very high metabolic demands. Notably the CNS consumes 20% of
the body’s oxygen supply. While the metabolic requirements for neural activity have been well
characterized, the energetic requirement for myelin formation and maintenance, as well as the
mechanisms for energetic production in myelinating cells, are not well understood [ 159].
