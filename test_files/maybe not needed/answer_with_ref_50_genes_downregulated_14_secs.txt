Mannosidases (Manba, Man1a1) are involved in glycoprotein processing, and sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (Sqor) is involved in sulfur metabolism.

4. **Immune Response and Inflammation:**
   - **Genes Involved:** Aif1l, Cxcl14, Tril, P2ry2
   - **Significance Explanation:** These genes are associated with immune signaling and inflammatory responses. CXCL14 is a chemokine involved in immune cell recruitment, while P2Y2 receptors participate in purinergic signaling, influencing inflammation.

5. **Signal Transduction and Cell Communication:**
   - **Genes Involved:** Ccn3, Grb14, Srgap1, Ptgfr
   - **Significance Explanation:** These genes are involved in various signaling pathways. CCN3 is part of the cellular communication network, influencing cell growth and differentiation. GRB14 is an adapter protein in insulin signaling, and SRGAP1 is involved in Rho GTPase signaling, affecting cytoskeletal dynamics.

6. **Proteolysis and Protein Modification:**
   - **Genes Involved:** Prss12, Prss23, Pcsk5, Htra1
   - **Significance Explanation:** These genes encode proteases and enzymes involved in protein processing and modification. Serine proteases (Prss12, Prss23) and proprotein convertases (Pcsk5) are crucial for activating precursor proteins, while HTRA1 is involved in protein quality control.
