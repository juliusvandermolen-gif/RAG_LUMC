     - **TB31 (TB3-1):** Associated with translation regulation.
     - **EIF4EBP1 (EIF4EBP1, 4E-BP1, PHAS-I):** Regulates translation initiation by binding to eIF4E.
     - **EIF2B3 (EIF2B3, EIF-2B, EIF2BGAMMA):** Part of the eIF2B complex, crucial for translation initiation.
     - **GSPT2 (GSPT2, ERF3B, FLJ10441):** Involved in translation termination.

#### Reactome Pathways

1. **Reactome: R-HSA-72731**
   - **Pathway Name:** Eukaryotic Translation Termination
   - **Significance:** This pathway is essential for the proper termination of protein synthesis, ensuring that proteins are synthesized correctly and efficiently. The genes involved play a role in recognizing stop codons and releasing the newly synthesized polypeptide chain.
   - **Relevant Genes:**
     - **SUP45L1 (ETF1, ERF, ERF1, RF1):** Functions as a release factor in translation termination.
     - **GSPT2 (GSPT2, ERF3B, FLJ10441):** Works with eRF1 to promote the release of the polypeptide chain.

2. **Reactome: R-HSA-72649**
   - **Pathway Name:** Eukaryotic Translation Initiation
   - **Significance:** This pathway is critical for the initiation phase of protein synthesis, where ribosomes are assembled on mRNA templates. The genes involved are key players in the regulation of this process.
   - **Relevant Genes:**
     - **EIF4EBP1 (EIF4EBP1, 4E-BP1, PHAS-I):** Inhibits the initiation of translation by binding to eIF4E.
     - **EIF2B3 (EIF2B3, EIF-2B, EIF2BGAMMA):** Part of the eIF2B complex, which is necessary for the exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2, a critical step in translation initiation.
