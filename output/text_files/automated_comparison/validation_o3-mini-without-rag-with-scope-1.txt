It appears that the list of found (user-provided) pathways is missing from your message. To perform the validation against the provided ground truth pathways and generate a table with the required details, please supply the list of pathways you identified. Once I have that list, I can compare each entry to the ground truth, mark hits versus no hits, and indicate if any pathways are novel.
