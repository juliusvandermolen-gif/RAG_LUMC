In addition, neural 
crest derived satellite glia maintain a tight communication with the 
soma of sensory, sympathetic, and parasympathetic neurons and neural 
crest derivatives are furthermore an indispensable part of the enteric 
nervous system. The remarkable plasticity of SCs becomes evident in the 
context of a nerve injury, where SC transdifferentiate into intriguing 
repair cells, which orchestrate a regenerative response that promotes 
nerve repair. Indeed, the multiple adaptations of SCs are captivating, but 
remain often ill-resolved on the molecular level. Here, we summarize 
and discuss the knowns and unknowns of the vast array of functions that 
this single cell type can cover in peripheral nervous system develop -

The cognate molecule in the Schwann cell membrane 
binding to 
 PrPC remains to be identified. Moreover, it is not 
known whether the  PrPC-mediated signaling may converge 
on the NRG1-ErbB2 axis in Schwann cells. Lgi4 and ADAM22. ADAM22 in the axon has no 
secretase activity but rather acts as receptor for Lgi4 (leucine-rich repeat LGI family member 4) secreted by Schwann cells (Fig. 2) [69]. Analysis of the spontaneous 
mutant claw paw (clp) carrying a recessive mutation in Lgi4 revealed a key role for this molecule in promoting myelina-tion during development [70]. Nerves from the claw paw mutant are severely hypomyelinated and present defects in radial sorting. Consistent with this, nerves from conditional mutants lacking ADAM22 are also hypomyelinated [69]. The precise mechanisms of action of Lgi4 and ADAM22 in the PNS, which are not restricted to the axo-glia juxtacrine interaction, remain to be clarified. Notch-1 .

Egr2/Krox20 is a master transcription factor of myelina-
tion whose loss in mice results in the arrest of Schwann cells at the pro-myelinating stage in a 1:1 relationship with the axon and in a-myelinated axons [ 39, 48]. Krox20 cooper -
ates with Sox10 to promote myelination and activates the expression of myelin genes, encoding structural proteins of compact myelin such as P0 and PMP22 [33]. Myelin biosyn-thesis also involves the activation of SREBP (sterol regula-tory element-binding protein) transcription factors, which promote lipid biosynthesis [49, 50] (see following section 
on myelin biogenesis). To induce myelination, inhibitors of myelination must 
also be repressed at the transcriptional level. Of note, Krox20 itself acts to inhibit Oct6, c-Jun (Jun proto-oncogene, AP-1 
transcription factor subunit) and Sox2, which are elevated in 
iSCs [33, 34, 51]. At the induction of myelination, c-Jun and 
Sox2 are also repressed by the transcription factor Zeb2 (zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2) [52, 53].

Pro‑myelinating Signals from the Axon
Neuregulin 1. In the PNS, axons with a diameter bigger than  
1 µm are myelinated, whereas axons smaller than 1 µm in diameter are unmyelinated and form Remak bundles [1 , 26]. This observation led to the hypothesis that an “axonal deter -
minant” dictates the fate of Schwann cells at the transition from iSCs to myelin-forming or non-myelin forming, but the identity of this factor remained elusive for many decades [26]. NRG1 (neuregulin) signaling influences all develop-
mental stages of Schwann cells, starting from SCPs, when Schwann cells are dependent on axons for their migration, proliferation, and survival [25, 57]. NRG1 is a member of 
the epidermal growth factor (EGF) superfamily, which com-prises several alternatively spliced transmembrane protein isoforms [1 ]. NRG1 isoforms are classified on six different 
classes, of which types I–III are the most abundant. NRG1 type I is a soluble isoform acting as a paracrine 
signal mainly expressed by Schwann cells.

(bottom ), isoprenoids give rise to farnesyl and geranylgeranyl moieties (protein modification), dolichol (protein glycosylation), 
ubiquinone, and heme A (respiratory chain). Enzyme activity of mevalonate kinase (1) is lost in patients with mevalonic aciduria and strongly reduced in patients with hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever syndrome (HIDS) (Houten and others 1999; Drenth and others 1999) (red bar).

Here, 
we will specifically discuss signaling pathways that promote the transition of iSCs to pro-myelinating and fully differenti-ated myelin-forming Schwann cells. Transcriptional Regulation of Myelination
Schwann cell differentiation into a myelin-forming pheno-type requires a sequential activation of transcription factors (TFs). In the transition to a pro-myelinating phenotype, 2172 A. Bolino

vated B cells), Oct6 (Pou3f1, POU class 3 homeobox 1), Brn2 (Pou3f2, POU class 3 homeobox 2), Sox10 (SRY-box transcription factor 10), NFATc4 (nuclear factor of activated T cells 4), and YY1 (Yin-Yang transcription factor 1) are all upregulated and activated [33, 34]. Of note, NF-kB is 
required for Schwann cell myelination in vitro, whereas its role in vivo is unclear [35]. Sox10 activates Oct6, which together with Brn2 promote the expression and activation of Egr2 (early growth response 2/Krox20) [36]. Krox20, the master transcription factor of myelination, is also activated by NFATc4 and YY1, cooperatively with Sox10 [ 37–39] 
and by Tead1 (TEA domain) with YAP/TAZ co-activators downstream of the tumor suppressor Hippo signaling path-way [ 40].

The peripheral myelination of the nerves is endorsed by axonal neuregulin 1 type
III (Nrg1-III) through downstream signaling pathways activation, such as PI3K/Akt and
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK, which ultimately regulate the master
transcriptional regulators of myelin genes, such as Krox20 [30]. The thickness of the
myelin is controlled by the amount of Nrg1-III, whose action is moderated by the secre-
tases -site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and tumor necrosis
factor- converting enzyme (TACE) through distinct extracellular cleavage mechanisms [ 9]. Niacin/Niaspan (nicotinic acid) may improve focal hypermyelination, avoid myelin deteri-

Importantly, a Sec23-interacting protein (Sec23ip,
also called p125A), which is also enriched in ER exit sites, is a member
of a family of three proteins that possess DDHD domains. (DDHD do-
mains are 180 amino acid protein modules that selectively binds PA and
can also be found in the lipid transfer proteins, Nir2/3 [ 57]). The other
two proteins of this family, DDHD1 and DDHD2 are phospholipase A1(PLA) enzymes capable of generating lyso-PI and lyso-PA, respectively
(PLA activity has not been demonstrated for Sec23ip/p125 [ 74]. That
said, Sec23ip/p125 was found to be important in the functional as-sembly of ER exit sites [ 75,76] and was shown to depend on both PA
and PI4P [ 77]. Sar1 was also shown to promote the local generation of
PI4P, a lipid that promoted Sar1-induced membrane constriction and
COPII assembly in an in vitro ER-budding assay, presumably through
the activity of one class of the four PI 4-kinases (PI4Ks), namely the type
II PI4Ks [ 73]. Another report found that the number of ER exit sites was
decreased in cells depleted in another PI4K, the type III PI4K, PI4KA[78], although this e ﬀect could be secondary as many changes to cel-
lular lipid levels have been shown to follow PI4KA depletion [ 79].

Active lesions: in response to des truction of the lipid-rich myelin sheet, expression of cholesterol synth esis genes is reduced in
most glial cells and neurons ( ‘Shutdown ’). Myelin clearance by CNS phagocytes, predominantly microglia, is essential for the resolution of in ﬂammation and the
establishment of a local proregenerative microenvironment that allows oligodendrocyte differentiation. Following myelin uptake, which involve s TAM receptor tyrosine
kinases (Tyro3, Axl, MerTK), microg lia synthesize the liver X receptor (LXR) ligand desmoste rol to enable ATP binding cas sette subfamily A member 1 ( ABCA1)-
mediated cholesterol ef ﬂux ( ‘Lipid recycling ’) and adaption of an anti-in ﬂammatory expression pro ﬁle [e.g., interleukin-10 (IL-10), arginase 1 (Arg1)]. Thus, in acute
experimental lesions, oligodendrocytes rely on lipid import, presumabl y by upregulating lipid receptors such as scavenger receptor class B, membe r 3 (CD36), for
differentiation and myelination. Chronic lesion: chronic experimental demyelination leads to suboptimal lipid recycling and the appearance of nu merous foamy phagocytes,
possibly a consequence of ineffective LXR signaling ( ‘Exhausted microglia ’).

Concerning radial myelin growth and thickness, several negative regulators have been identified most of them converging on the NRG1 pathway [1 ]. As 
described before, TACE secretase cleaves NRG1 type III and negatively regulates its activity and myelination [65]. PTEN phosphatase downregulates 
 PIP3 levels and Akt-mTORC1 
activation, thus also negatively regulating myelination [86, 87]. Of note, the Dlg1/SAP97 (Discs Large 1/synapse asso-ciated protein 97) is a scaffolding protein of the MAGUK family that has been shown to potentiate PTEN activity and to negatively regulate the Akt-mTORC1 signaling [103]. In turn, Dlg1 is negatively regulated by the Kif13b unconven-tional kinesin motor protein, that promotes p38ɣ -MAPK 
Dlg1 phosphorylation and ubiquitination [104]. Kif13b is thus a positive regulator of myelination. REDD1 (Regu-lated in development and DNA damage responses 1/Ddti4) is another negative regulator of mTORC1, which acts by stimulating TSC1/2. Consistent with this, Ddit4 KO nerves display increased myelin thickness [105].

These hFNSC-derived astrocytes were 
exposed to hypoxia for 48 h which was validated by an increase in the 
expression of the hypoxia-responsive protein, HIF1 α. Transcriptomic 
changes in hypoxia-exposed astrocytes interestingly revealed upregu -
lation of pathways involved in steroid biosynthesis. The upregulated 
genes included key enzymes of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway 
including HMG-coA reductase (HMGCR), mevalonate kinase (MK) and 
squalene epoxidase (SQLE). Cholesterol within the central nervous system is produced de novo, as 
cholesterol from the circulation cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Within the CNS, cholesterol is produced by astrocytes, neurons as well as 
oligodendrocytes with astrocytes serving as a source for cholesterol for 
other cell types during times of need [13]. Cholesterol is transported in 
the form of ApoE-containing lipoproteins. Astrocytes express ABCA1 for 
the efflux of cholesterol and form lipoprotein-like particles which are 
taken up by oligodendrocytes and neurons using LDL-receptor (LDLR), scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SRB1) or LDL-R related protein 1/2 
(LRP1/2) [14].

How can PMP22  overexpression  change  MYC expression  as rationalized by chatGPT  
 
Certainly! Let’s explore how overexpression of  PMP22 
(Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 ) could influence  MYC expression, considering mechanisms 
in cell biology and biochemistry . Backgroun d 
• PMP2 2 is a transmembrane glycoprotein primarily 
expressed in Schwann cells, contributing to myelin 
sheath formation. It is also involved in regulating cell 
growth, adhesion, and apoptosis. • MYC is a transcription factor that regulates genes 
involved in proliferation , metabolism, and apoptosis. Possible Mechanisms Linking PMP22 
Overexpression to MYC Expressio n 
1. Altered Signaling Pathway s: 
• PMP22 is known to interact with signaling pathways, particularly those involving cell 
growth and differentiation. Overexpressi on may activate or inhibit signaling cascades 
like PI3K -AKT or MAP K. 
• These pathways can modulate  MYC expression directly or indirectly through upstream 
regulators such as  mTO R or transcription factors like  NF-κB.

We point out, of course, that
co-immunoprecipitation ( ‘interaction ’) of any given protein with PMP22 does not prove direct interaction with
that protein, only that they populate the same complex. However, in light of the limited number of proteins
identi ﬁed in the proteomic screen and given that many other interactors are proteins that are known or
expected to interact with PMP22, it seems unlikely that co-IP of PMP22 with six different proteins all related
to cholesterol homeostasis re ﬂects experimental noise or another form of artifact. PGRMC1 (the progesterone receptor membrane component 1) is an ER protein known to interact with pro-
teins of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway [ 32]. PGRMC1 has been shown to bind to and stabilize various
members of the cytochrome P450 enzyme family in various steroidogenic pathways [ 32]. Its primary role in
cholesterol homeostasis has been shown to be through regulation of sterol 14 α-demethylase (CYP51) in
Schizosaccharomyces pombe , HEK 293 cells, and in breast cancers cells where it promotes ergosterol/cholesterol
biosynthesis [ 32–34].

Disruption of this complex in mice leads to aberrant folding in older animals [76]. In the abaxonal membrane, the G protein-coupled receptor GPR56 has been found to have a role in myelin mainte-nance [77]. Gpr56 mutants display increased myelin thick -
ness, Cajal band disorganization, and progressive defects of myelin maintenance in older mice. The cytoskeletal scaf-folding protein Plectin has been identified as an interact-ing partner of GPR56 to regulate myelin development and homeostasis [77].2175 Myelin Biology
1 3Another G protein-coupled receptor, GPR126, on the 
abaxonal membrane binds collagen IV and Laminin 211 and 
is required for radial sorting and therefore for differentiation and myelination [78– 80]. GPR126 has also a separate role in 
controlling cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) levels in Schwann cells through activation of adenylate cyclase. cAMP in turn activates PKA (protein kinase A), which converges on Oct-6 and Krox-20 transcription factors for myelination [79, 81].

At the onset of myeli -
nation, mTORC1 activation declines but still at sufficient levels to allow lipid and protein synthesis downstream of Krox20 activation and membrane wrapping [91]. To further corroborate this conclusion, moderate mTORC1 activa-tion has been recently shown to be associated with aber -
rant myelin formation, as observed in mutants with loss of the MTMR2 (myotubularin-related protein 2) phosphatase and its activator Rab35 GTPase [92– 94]. MTMR2 is a cata-
lytically active phosphatase, which regulates the turnover of PtdIns(3,5)P
2 in Schwann cells [95]. MTMR2 acts in com-
plex with MTMR13, another myotubularin which instead is catalytically inactive, but potentiates MTMR2 activity also by regulating its subcellular localization [96]. In Rab35 and Mtmr2 KO mutants, elevated PtdIns(3,5)P
2 levels overacti-
vate mTORC1 and cause aberrant myelin [93, 94]. YAP/TAZ. Transcription co-activator Yes-associated pro-
tein 1 (YAP) and its coactivator with PDZ-binding domain

[97]. YAP/TAZ can be phosphorylated and localized in the cytosol, or viceversa, not phosphorylated and translocate in the nucleus, promoting transcription by binding to TEAD (TEA domain transcription factor) tran-scription factors. Phosphorylation and thus inactivation of YAP/TAZ is mediated by the canonical Hippo pathway, which consists of a cascade of kinases activated by a pleth-ora of extracellular and intracellular biological stimuli. Spe-cifically, in Schwann cells, NF2 (neurofibromin, also called merlin or Schwannomin) activates the Hippo cascade simi-larly to the Crb3 polarity protein, which is localized at the edge of mature Schwann cell internodes [19, 23]. When 
final internodal length is achieved, Crb3 is expressed and localizes at microvilli, leading to activation of the Hippo pathway, and inhibition of YAP/TAZ. On the contrary, dur -
ing longitudinal myelin growth, Crb3 is not expressed and localized at microvilli, Hippo is inactive, YAP/TAZ are not 2176 A. Bolino

Therefore, the overexpression of these genes may
have a therapeutic effect on CMT1B. 3.2.9. Colony-Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor Inhibitor
The neuropathic phenotype is promoted by low-grade inﬂammation from phagocytiz-
ing macrophages in mice models for CMT1A, CMT1B, and CMTX1. Colony-stimulating
factor (CSF1) is a macrophage activator expressed by endoneurial ﬁbroblasts. It mediates
macrophage-related neural impairment in mice and humans with CMT. Consequently, oral
administration of the CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX5622 followed by a vigorous
decrease in the number of macrophages in the peripheral nerves of Cx32def mice; more-
over, long-term CSF1R inhibition was reported to improve axonal integrity in these mice. However, although long-term CSF1R inhibition reduced the neuropathic patterns in P0het
mutants, it did not produce the same effect in PMP22 tg mutants [52]. 3.2.10. Sodium Channel Blockers
Dysmyelination in Mpz knockout mice associates with the ectopic expression of the
sensory neuron-speciﬁc sodium channel isoform NaV1.8 on motor axons.

Together, our results reveal that dur -
ing normal development and following nerve regeneration, plas -
malogens are crucial for Schwann cells to sort axons, myelinate, and to sustain axons and myelin levels in the PNS. Plasmalogens regulate AKT activation at the plasma membrane. To 
elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effects of plasmalogen deficiency in Schwann cells, we analyzed key kinases in sciatic 
nerves from P15 WT and Gnpat-KO mice. Levels of phosphorylated 
c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and downstream targets of the GTP-binding proteins of 
the Rho family (namely, N-WASP, myosin light chain, and cofilin) 
were normal in Gnpat-KO nerves (data not shown). However, we observed a 3-fold decrease in AKT phosphorylation (Figure 5A) and in the phosphorylation of two of its targets, GSK3β  (Figure 5B) 
and c-RAF (Figure 5C). The defective phosphorylation of AKT was 
unrelated to altered levels of phosphorylated PDK1 (Figure 5D) or PTEN (Figure 5E), two upstream regulators of AKT activation.

Moreover, improvements in mitochondrial membrane potential and integrity
were observed, resulting in improved myelination and nerve function [38]. 3.2.3. Sephin-1
Sephin-1 (IFB-088), which inhibits eIF2a dephosphorylation (a kinase in the PERK arm
of the UPR) and lengthens protein translation reduction in response to stress, showed to
be beneﬁcial in both S63del and R98C Mpz mouse models by sustaining the response and
avoiding molecular, morphological, and motor ﬂaws of neuropathy [39]. At present, Sephin-1 is being evaluated in CMT1A rodent models, making it a potential
candidate for clinical experiments in both CMT1A and CMT1B [ 22]. Theoretically, this
technique may also be useful for other mutants retained in the ER. Genes 2023 ,14, 1391 8 of 17
3.2.4. Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2-Phosphorylation (eIF2 ) and Gadd34
Human CMT1B neuropathy and similar demyelinating in transgenic mice are caused
by the mutant P0S63del, which is reserved in the ER, activating a UPR. In the presence of ER
stress, protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) phosphorylates eIF2 to
decrease the global translation, thus lessening the misfolded protein overload in the ER.

3.3  |  Proteomic profiling confirms and extends 
known disturbances in subcellular degradative 
pathways and the inflammatory response
Previously, we described the presence of PMP22 protein aggre-
gates and upregulation of the ubiquitin- proteasome and autophagy-  
lysosomal pathways in nerves of TrJ mice (Fortun et al., 2003; Notterpek et al., 1997). In accord, the KEGG pathway represent-
ing the mouse proteasome distinguishes 47 proteins known to be 
annotated to the proteasome in the corresponding literature. Of 
the 37 proteasomal protein peptide signatures identified within the 
nerves of TrJ mice, 21 are differentially expressed. Those with dif-
ferential expressions cause a disturbance in the subunit composi-
tion of the proteasome (Figure 5a). The overproduced proteins are 
known to interact, creating the proteasomal complex, and are regu-
lated by the single reduced protein, the proteasome inhibitor subu-
nit 1 (Figure 5b). The elevated expression of proteins encompassing 
each subunit of the proteasome suggests an attempt to enhance 
proteolysis within affected neuropathic nerves.

Amplification of Myc together with other oncogenes ( e.g., 
epidermal growth factor receptor 1  gene) was associated with emergence of hormone-
resistant (castration-resistant) prostate cancer [ 12]. Studies have also indicated that increased 
nuclear Myc protein level is an early event in the pathogenesis of human prostate cancer and 
evident in luminal cells of PIN lesions [ 13]. Moreover, Myc overexpression was observed in 
roughly 70% of early stage prostate cancer [ 14]. Nuclear Myc protein expression was 
associated with prostate cancer progression and it was suggested to be a possible predictor 
of two-year overall survival [ 15]. At the biochemical level, deregulated metabolism is one of the hallmarks of different cancers 
including prostate adenocarcinoma [ 16–18]. Prostate cancers frequently exhibit increased de 
novo  synthesis of fatty acids, which is very low in normal prostate gland [ 17, 18]. In prostate 
cancer, citrate from tricarboxylic acid cycle is utilized for the synthesis of acetyl-CoA that is 
eventually converted to saturated fatty acids ( e.g., C16:0 palmitic acid) and further 
metabolized to unsaturated fatty acids ( e.g., oleic acid, an omega-9 monounsaturated fatty 
acid) through a series of catalytic reactions facilitated by ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), acetyl-
CoA carboxylase 1 (a rate limiting enzyme; ACC1 or ACACA), fatty acid synthase (FASN) 
complex, elongases, and desaturases [ 17, 18].

Ten to 15 nonoverlapping images were obtained and used for all determinations. Cell culture and in vitro myelination. MEFs were prepared from E12 
embryos and cultured in high-glucose DMEM with 10% FBS and anti-biotics. Primary Schwann cells were isolated from sciatic nerves of 4-day-old WT and Gnpat-KO mice and cultured in high-glucose DMEM with 10% normal horse serum (NHS) and antibiotics. Schwann cells were serum starved for 12 hours before stimulation with 30 ng/ml recombi-nant human neuregulin 1 β  EGF-like domain (R&D Systems). The lysates 
were prepared after 0, 7, and 15 minutes at 37°C. Serum-starved MEFs were stimulated with 10% FBS for 0, 1, 3, and 5 minutes. The lysates were prepared in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors  
(cOmplete, Mini; Roche), and 2 mM orthovanadate. In vitro myelination was performed as described (45). Mixed cultures 
of DRG neurons and Schwann cells from WT (n  = 7) and Gnpat -KO  
(n = 4) embryos were maintained in high-glucose MEM with 2 mM  
L-glutamine, 10% FBS, 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF) (2.5S; Millipore), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and were then plated onto 13-mm-diameter  
Matrigel-coated coverslides (1:10 in DMEM).
