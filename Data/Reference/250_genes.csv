●Compounds preventing axonal degeneration or rescuing altered axo-
nal transport have the potentiality to cure many hereditary neuro -
pathies irrespective of the primary triggering defect: this is the case 
for the inhibitors of SARM1 and of HDAC6, an active field of research. ●Intervention on more specific metabolic pathways is also promising, 
such as for L-Serine to treat HSN1 by reducing neurotoxic deoxy -
sphingolipids, or compounds acting on the PYKfive enzyme in the 
phosphoinositides metabolism in CMT4B, or S-adenosylmethionine 
(SAM) to supply purine nucleotides in CMTX5 and its allelic disorders. ●Mutations in sorbitol dehydrogenase has been very recently asso -
ciated with a relatively common form of CMT2/dHMN and high levels 
of sorbitol. Inhibitors of aldose reductase, developed in the past for 
diabetic neuropathy, are good candidates for its treatment. Table 1. List of CMT genes associated with the different types of CMT and related neuropathies. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and related neuropathies

genes ( PMP22 ,GJB1 ,MPZ ,MFN2 ,SH3TC2 ,GDAP1 ,NEFL ,LITAF ,GARS ,HSPB1 ,FIG4 ,
EGR2 ,PRX , and RAB7A ) related to CMT in a cohort study of 17,880 patients tested in a
commercial genetic laboratory. Genetic anomalies were detected in 18.5% (n = 3312) of the
total population. Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampliﬁcation
revealed that duplications (56.7%) or deletions (21.9%) in PMP22 were reported for most of
the positive results; next, mutations were detected in GJB1 (6.7%), MPZ (5.3%), and MFN2
(4.3%). GJB1 deletions and mutations in the residual genes were 5.3% of the anomalies. Of
the individuals presenting a positive genetic outcome in a CMT-related gene, 94.9% had a
mutation in one of the following four genes ( PMP22 ,GJB1 ,MPZ , orMFN2 ) [8]. Effective pharmacological treatments for CMT are currently lacking. This review dis-

Next, we asked whether the disease biomarkers identified in 
the C22 transcriptomic study can be confirmed in the CMT1A rat 
model. Consistent with findings in C22 mice, the mRNA levels of lipid biosynthetic genes such as Sc5d and Ugt8a were decreased in CMT1A rats, although to a lesser extent than in C22 mouse nerves. ASO6 treatment trended toward increased mRNA levels of these genes (Figure 3G). Furthermore, the mRNA levels of Id2  
and Bzw2  were significantly increased in CMT1A rats compared 
with WT rats and were substantially decreased following ASO6 treatment (Figure 3G). Finally, we sought to identify a target engagement biomarker 
in the CMT1A rats. Toward this end, we collected blood and foot -
pad skin biopsies from treated CMT1A rats. Although there was detectable rat Pmp22 mRNA in the blood, there was no change in Pmp22 levels following ASO6 treatment (Supplemental Fig -
ure 5E). The level of rat Pmp22 mRNA in the footpad (containing dermal nerves and Schwann cells) was significantly reduced in ASO6- compared with control-treated rats, suggesting this could serve as a biomarker of target engagement (Figure 3H)."

The intracellular domain of dystroglycan interacts 
with DRP2 and L-PRX. DG (dystroglycan) conditional KO in Schwann cells display a neuropathic phenotype morpho-logically characterized by irregular folding of myelin, dis-organization of microvilli, and consequent altered clustering of 
 Na+ channels at the node [14]. These features are not 
typical of laminin mutants and their receptors in develop-ment such as β1 integrin, suggesting that this phenotype is not due to altered ECM-Schwann cell communication. One hypothesis is that loss of function of proteins within the DG complex in Schwann cells leads to myelin instability [14]. DRP2 and L-PRX anchor DG in the Schwann cell apposi-tions, which defines the boundaries of the cytoplasm-filled adjacent regions, the Cajal bands (Fig. 1b, d) [13, 15, 17]. Consistent with this, in addition to Cajal bands disruption, loss of either PRX or of DRP2 is associated with myelin abnormalities that share similarities with those observed in the DG mutant. Other adhesion molecules involved in myelin stability in 
this region is the integrin α6 β4."

Somewhat surprisingly, of the 2,080 DEGs that are induced in the C22 model, only 43 were found to be induced in 
expression analyses of different time points after nerve injury (41, 
44, 45), including the Pou3f1 transcription factor expressed in pro -
myelinating Schwann cells as well as other transcription factors, 
such as Sox4 and Id2  (Supplemental Figure 2, E and F). Indeed, 
none of the previously described c-Jun  target genes (41) were 
induced in the C22 model, indicating that other transcriptional 
programs were enacted by PMP22 overexpression in this model. Relatively few cytokines/chemokines were induced in the C22 model, with the exception of Cxcl14  (46), and immune cell mark -
ers were not an enriched gene ontology category with this data set 
(Supplemental Figure 2G). We next determined whether ASO-mediated suppression 
could restore gene-expression levels toward WT levels and 
found 97 DEGs that behaved in this manner. Among this set, 76 overlapped with the 746 DEGs that significantly changed in the comparison of C22 and WT cohorts at 5 or 15 weeks (Sup -

Several of the deregulat -
ed genes (c-Jun , Pou3f1, Id2, Ednrb ) have been shown to inhibit 
myelination and/or myelin gene expression (41, 50–52). The pro -
filing of ASO-treated animals provided further insight into those gene expression changes, such as those observed for Id2  and 
Bzw2 , that are restored upon ASO treatment. Since this group is 
relatively small (<100), this provides important information on treatment-responsive gene expression changes that help normal-
ize Schwann cell function. Future measurement of these genes 
along with PMP22 mRNA in skin biopsies (as done in the foot pad analysis) could provide important biomarkers that can be used in clinical trials. Since overreduction of PMP22 levels could theoreti-cally cause the HNPP neuropathy caused by loss of a PMP22 allele, evaluation of PMP22 mRNA and other biomarkers can be used to monitor for this clinically. Overall, these studies demonstrate the potential therapeutic utility of ASOs in treating CMT1A and eluci-date the gene expression networks that respond to successful res-
toration of normalized PMP22 levels."

However, it was
found that ABCA1-dependent cholesterol ef ﬂux was decreased. This was detected as a sharp decrease in ApoE
secretion (along with cholesterol) in PMP22 KO SC cultures. Decreased cholesterol ef ﬂux was explained by
observation that traf ﬁcking of ABCA1 to the plasma membrane was signi ﬁcantly decreased. This was found
when cyclosporin A-blocking endocytosis of plasma membrane-associated ABCA1 resulted in no effect on
levels of secreted cholesterol, suggesting minimal levels of ABCA1 at the plasma membrane of PMP22 KOmouse SCs. Reduced levels of ABCA1 at the plasma membrane were con ﬁrmed by cell surface immuno ﬂuores-
cence microscopy in both nerves and cultured SCs. These results in PMP22 KO mice suggest an important role for PMP22 in promoting ABCA1-mediated chol-
esterol export from SCs, although the mechanism remains uncertain. Interestingly, PMP22 protein levels in
ABCA1 KO mouse nerves were increased 1.5-fold over WT while other myelin genes MAG, MPZ, and p75
remained relatively unchanged."

Mutations in MPZ 
can prevent the mutant protein from reaching the membrane 
and cause its retention and accumulation in the ER inducing 
apoptosis and subsequent neuropathy. Retention of the 
mutant proteins in the ER leads to activation of the UPR, an 
adaptive and protective process to relieve stress from mis-
folded proteins (Figure 2). However, when cells are in chronic 
stress, such as in CMT1B, the UPR becomes inadequate, and it 
activates apoptotic pathways resulting in cell death or abnor -
mal signaling. Many MPZ mutations were shown to activate 
the UPR and cause CMT1B, and these mutations may be 
susceptible to future therapies targeting the UPR [32]. The 
first studies showed a potential benefit from curcumin, 
which is able to modulate the UPR among its many activities 
[33,34]. More recently, Sephin-1 (IFB-088) – an inhibitor of the 
dephosphorylation of eIF2a, a kinase belonging to the PERK 
arm of the UPR – that prolongs protein translation attenuation 
in response to stress, was shown to be beneficial in the S63del 
and R98C MPZ mouse models, prolonging the response and 
preventing the molecular, morphological and motor defects of 
the neuropathy [35,36]."

Mutations in the CRAC motif resulted in a decoupling of PMP22 and cholesterol
trafﬁcking with PMP22 primarily being retained in the ER and Golgi in SCs. The above observation suggests that at least one other factor may be involved in shunting cholesterol to the
Golgi, post-synthesis. MPZ is a possible candidate since it is known that its ER exit to the Golgi is cholesterol-
dependent, a phenomenon diminished by mutations in its putative cholesterol binding sequence [ 53]. MPZ
and PMP22 were recently shown to directly interact in a cholesterol-dependent manner via their transmem-brane segments (the ectoplasmic end of the 2nd transmembrane helix of PMP22 interacts with the ectoplasmic
end of the MPZ transmembrane helix) [ 54]. This interaction seems to be functionally important as evidenced
by the fact that the A67T mutation, which causes a mild form of CMT, maps to this putative binding interface.However, traf ﬁcking of either protein to the PM does not appear to be dependent on the other [ 54,55]."

How can PMP22  overexpression  change  MYC expression  as rationalized by chatGPT  
 
Certainly! Let’s explore how overexpression of  PMP22 
(Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 ) could influence  MYC expression, considering mechanisms 
in cell biology and biochemistry . Backgroun d 
• PMP2 2 is a transmembrane glycoprotein primarily 
expressed in Schwann cells, contributing to myelin 
sheath formation. It is also involved in regulating cell 
growth, adhesion, and apoptosis. • MYC is a transcription factor that regulates genes 
involved in proliferation , metabolism, and apoptosis. Possible Mechanisms Linking PMP22 
Overexpression to MYC Expressio n 
1. Altered Signaling Pathway s: 
• PMP22 is known to interact with signaling pathways, particularly those involving cell 
growth and differentiation. Overexpressi on may activate or inhibit signaling cascades 
like PI3K -AKT or MAP K. 
• These pathways can modulate  MYC expression directly or indirectly through upstream

This also implies reversibility of the symptoms, since unmyelinated axons are apparent in the CMT1A rat model even at 5 weeks of age (12). Therefore, dramatic improvement is observed with cellular, elec-
trophysiological, and functional measures of peripheral neuropa -
thy. Despite the promising results, there remain several important questions, including whether sustained treatment will lead to continued improvement, whether it will prevent axonal loss, and whether it will work in older animals, in which axonal loss con-tributes to clinical manifestation (49). Future work will also be required to determine optimal dosing route and frequency as well as detailed characterization of ASO pharmacokinetic and pharma -
codynamic properties in peripheral nerves. In addition to the improvements induced by ASOs, these stud-
ies also afforded the opportunity to perform an RNA-seq profile of the C22 model, which identified several genes that were previous-ly shown to be upregulated in CMT1A models (c-Jun , Pou3f1, and 
Cxcl14 ) and also those that are downregulated (lipid biosynthetic 
genes and other myelin-related genes)."

CMT1A exhibits dysregulated lipid biosynthesis
Comparative microarrays were used to compare gene expression from sciatic nerves of WT rats with mildly and
severely affected CMT1A model rats expressing a 3rd WT PMP22 allele [ 24]. It was found that dysregulation of
22 lipid metabolism genes correlated with disease severity. In both mildly and severely affected animals mostexamined lipid metabolism genes were down-regulated at both 1 week and 9 weeks of age. Interestingly, there
was an age-dependent switch between mildly affected and severely affected rats with mildly affected rats exhibit-
ing more lipid biosynthetic gene dysregulation at 1 week of age and severely affected rats exhibiting more lipidbiosynthesis gene dysregulation at 9 weeks of age. Follow-up quantitative PCR experiments validated Adipoq,
Lpl, Scd1, Pparg, Prkar2b, Ssg1, and Thrsp as being dysregulated. Figure 1. Cartoon representation for the AlphaFold2-predicted structure of PMP22. Highlighted are locations of the CRAC motif in TM4 (residues 147 –159, red), CARC motif in TM3 (residues 92 –104, blue), and

Finally, other CMT proteins interact with the F-actin cytoskeleton such as PRX (CMT4F) or regulates its assembly, such as FGD4, a GEF for Cdc42 GTPase, which is mutated in the autosomal recessive CMT4H. In conclusion, the generation and characterization of ani -
mal models for these neuropathies as well as the increasing number of IPN genes identified using NGS (next generation sequencing) technologies has enormously contributed to expand and deep our knowledge on myelin biology. In turn, the knowledge of the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms allowed to design and validate at the preclinical level prom-ising therapeutical approaches, which can be potentially translated to human in a near future [129– 133].

These findings were consistent with the motor behavior and electrophysiology charac-terizations of the C22 cohort described in Figure 1. This was, to our knowledge, the first RNA-seq profiling of 
a CMT1A model, and the analysis showed some categories of 
genes in common with microarray profiles of other CMT1A mod-
els (34, 37 , 38). For example, there was a significant decrease in cholesterol and lipid biosynthetic genes as well as myelin-related genes in 5-week-old C22 compared with WT littermates (Supple -
mental Figure 2, C and F). The increased gene categories include a number involved in cell signaling, as well as those involved in axon guidance mechanisms (RhoA , Plxna1, and Rac1 ) and inte -
grin signaling (Itgb8 ) (Supplemental Figure 2D). Expression of 
myelin inhibitors such as Id2 , Id4, and Ednrb  was also increased, 
suggesting an unfavorable environment for remyelination (Sup -
plemental Figure 2E). Dysregulation of several transcription fac-tors regulating Schwann cell differentiation was also observed in the C22 mice (Supplemental Figure 2F)."

[25]. mRNA expression of both lipid catabolizing and anabolizing transcripts were affected. This study further
showed that during development, lipid metabolism genes (including those of sterol metabolism) failed to
up-regulate in a CMT1A background compared with WT, suggesting a failure to engage lipid synthesis during
myelination. Lipidomics studies conducted on CMT1A rats and human serum samples [ 26] found that rat sciatic nerves
exhibited impaired sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism in which ceramides, sphingomyelins,
hexosylceramides, and sphingosine were all reduced in CMT1A samples [ 26]. An earlier study also found these
same lipid species to be reduced in CMT1A rat sciatic nerve myelin and also cholesterol, PC, and PG lipid
species [ 25,26]. The two studies tested regimens of lipid supplementation (by either adding lipids or various
components of different lipid biosynthetic pathways) and observed improvements in myelination. A transcriptomic analysis of C3 (CMT1A model) mice found that the most severely down-regulated genes
were those involved in cholesterol biosynthesis [ 27]."

In line with this idea, stimulation of the rat
sciatic nerve with ATP induces increases in the Ca
2? concentration in both the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix
in myelinating SCs. The ATP-induced cytoplasmic Ca2? increase is mediated by the signaling cascade consisting of
the activation of the P2Y2 purinergic receptor (P2RY2),production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP
3) via
hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by
phospholipase C, and Ca2?release from intracellular Ca2? stores via IP 3receptors. This P2Y2-IP 3-mediated cyto-
plasmic Ca2?mobilization subsequently induces
mitochondrial Ca2?signaling via the MCU. The physiological signiﬁcance of mitochondrial Ca2? signaling in myelinating SCs has been examined in vivo by
disrupting the P2RY2-IP 3-MCU pathway using shRNA for
P2RY2 (shP2RY2), or IP 3-5 phosphatase (5ppase), an
enzyme that suppress IP 3receptor-mediated Ca2?release
by rapidly hydrolyzing IP 3[56–62], or shRNA for MCU
(shMCU). Expression of shP2RY2, 5ppase, or shMCU in
myelinating SCs results in increased levels of phosphory-
lated AMPK, suggesting a critical role for P2RY2-IP 3-
MCU signaling in energy metabolism in myelinating SCs."

How-
ever, the exact contribution of these enzymes to these respective
pathways is still not all that clear. Similarly, some of the AGPAT (acyl-
glycero-phosphate acyl transferase) enzymes that catalyze the acylation
of lyso-phospholipids are found in the outer mitochondrial membrane
(e.g. AGPAT4 and AGPAT5) [ 3], whereas others are found in the ER. AGPAT enzymes are mostly believed to use lyso-PA to generate PA inthe de novo lipid synthetic pathway, but which isozymes are most
important for phospholipid synthesis is not yet known. Interestingly,
Agpat4−/−mice show signi ﬁcant decreases in phosphatidylinositol
(PI), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) butnot in phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphati-
dylglycerol (PG) or cardiolipin levels in the brain [ 6]; suggesting that
PA made on the outer surface of the mitochondria by this enzyme has toﬁnd its way to the ER, where the a ﬀected phospholipids are known to
be made, and that not all phospholipid synthetic pathways are fed
uniformly through the action of this enzyme."

The drug was administered to explant cultures of C22 mice, which im-
proved processing of PMP22 and enhanced myelin internodal proﬁle; it also increased the
production of other myelin-related proteins; nevertheless, despite these potential in vitro
outcomes, rapamycin did not recover neuromuscular performance in the Tr-J mouse model

The myelination status of SCs appears to be detected by the stability between opposing
signaling systems. Positive regulators such as Krox-20, Oct-6, Sox-10, Brn2, and NF- B are
predominant in normal nerves, but the balance shifts to negative regulators such as c-Jun,
Notch, Pax-3, Sox2, and Id2 in the injured and pathological nerves. In addition, negative
regulators may be important in the onset and myelination rate during growth (59). The
continued expression of Sox2 and Id2 seems to perform a protective function in neuropathy
since their elimination in P0S63del mice—a CMT1B mouse model—led to an exacerbation
of the dysmyelinating phenotype [ 51]."

One extensively stud-ied example is myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Although MAG also contains a CRAC motif (Saher and Simons 2010), it most likely does not associate with cho-lesterol. MAG is a member of the noncompact fraction of PNS and CNS myelin. In accordance with its localiza-tion, MAG is not found in detergent-resistant membranes (Erne and others 2002; Saher and others 2009). MAG is a single-span transmembrane glycoprotein with five extra-cellular Ig-like domains that are involved in adhesion of glial cells to axons. MAG supports long-term axon-myelin stability, despite its low abundance (Schnaar and Lopez 2009). Axonal degeneration of MAG null mice is preceded by alterations of the axonal cytoskeleton (Schnaar and Lopez 2009). Especially at the node of Ranvier, the correct distribution of axonal proteins (i.e., adhesion mol-ecules and ion channels) is influenced by MAG. To date, sialoglycans and Nogo receptors have been described as functional receptors for MAG (Kelm and others 1994; McGee and Strittmatter 2003)."

For further details on the molecular composition of these domains, we address the reader to seminal reviews on this topic [9 –12]. The outermost region of a myelinated fiber is not uni-
form but interrupted by appositions between the abaxonal Schwann cell membrane (the layer facing ECM, which is opposite to the adaxonal membrane) and the outer layer of the compact myelin [13] (Fig. 1b, d). These contacts are formed by the interaction between the ECM and the βDG (dystroglycan)-DRP2 (dystrophyn-related 2)-PRX (Peri-axin) complex, which intracellularly is linked to the F-actin cytoskeleton [14– 17]. These membrane appositions thus 
form longitudinal cytoplasmic channels called Cajal bands, which represent fast tracks for transport of molecules and organelles from the perinuclear region to the periphery [13]. Consistent with this, these channels contain microtubules, intermediate filaments, and F-actin. Cajal bands are also enriched in caveolae-mediating endocytosis from the extra-cellular environment, thus suggesting that these structures are also relevant for Schwann cell metabolism [1 , 4]."

This treatment
signiﬁcantly improved motor function and muscle volume in the Tr-J mice, as evidenced by
results from the rotarod test and magnetic resonance imaging analysis, respectively. When
Pmp22 -targeting siRNA coupled to squalenoyl nanoparticles are intravenously adminis-
tered in JP18 and JP18/JY13 mice models of CMT1A, they can decrease PMP22 levels and
improve locomotor function; nevertheless, the effects are short-lasting and recurrent doses
are needed [ 74]. A long-lasting RNAi therapy was administered by intraneurally injecting
an AAV2/9 vector expressing murine Pmp22 -targeting shRNA in a CMT1A rat model; this
model normalized PMP22 and MPZ protein levels and enhanced its function and myelina-
tion [ 75]. The transfection of regular and humanized transgenic neuropathic mouse SCs
with a microRNA 29a (miR-29a) expression plasmid decreased the levels of endogenous
mouse and transgenic human PMP22 transcripts compared to those in the control vector. Additionally, ectopic expression of miR-29a resulted in a considerable (approximately
50%) decrease in Pmp22 mRNA, corresponding to an approximate 20% decrease in PMP22
protein levels [ 76]."

CMT4 refers to demyeli-nating forms with autosomal recessive inheritance. Mutations in the genes encoding the EGR2 and SOX10 
transcription factors are associated with severe forms of neuropathies, and specifically with demyelination for EGR2  
mutations and with PNS/CNS hypomyelination for SOX10  
mutations. Genes encoding structural protein of the myelin sheath 
are also mutated in CMT. CMT1A, the most common form of CMT1, is due to duplication of a 1.4 Mb region on chro-mosome 17p including the PMP22 gene. More rarely, point mutations in PMP22 cause demyelinating CMT1E. The generation and characterization of several animal models for these neuropathies suggested that CMT1A is caused by altered PMP22 gene dosage, whereas CMT1E by a domi-
nant negative effect of the mutant PMP22 allele on the wild type allele. MPZ, the gene encoding myelin protein zero, is mutated in the autosomal dominant demyelinating CMT1B, caused by altered trafficking of P0 and loss of function at the plasma membrane leading to hypomyelination."

tivation of MYC in AZD8055-resistant tumors. We next per-formed transcription factor (TF) target enrichment analysisusing the TF target information collected from previouslypublished genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)assays and motif-based prediction, as deposited in the EnrichRresource ( Kuleshov et al., 2016 ). Upregulated genes in resistant
tumors showed the strongest enrichment for genes containing
binding sites for MYC as well as MYC-binding motifs ( Fig. 2, C
and D ). Finally, MS-expression proteomics data similarly re-
vealed the activation of MYC targets in resistant tumors ascompared with control and sensitive tumors ( Fig. 2, E and F ). Taken together, these data show that during long-term AZD8055treatment, MYC governs a transcriptional program potentiallydriving resistance to mTORi. MYC directs biological processes associated with
mTORi responseTo gain insight into the resistance-associated transcriptionalprograms mediated by MYC, we further explored the GSVAresults ( Fig."

4A; Verheijen and others 2009; Saher and others 2009). In both mutants, affected Schwann cells take up at least some cholesterol/lipids from other (nonrecombined) cells of the nerve, such as fibroblasts and macrophages. Consequently, the expres-sion of genes involved in cholesterol uptake, such as Apoe 
and Apod , is increased in peripheral nerves of SQS mutant 
mice (Saher and others 2009). In SCAP mutants, the altered

It
remains possible that MPZ ‘hands off ’its cholesterol to PMP22 in the Golgi, possibly by associating with
cholesterol-enriched nanodomains (discussed below), where PMP22 then co-traf ﬁcs with cholesterol to the
plasma membrane. In summary, PMP22 KO and L16P result in the retention of cholesterol in the Golgi while PMP22 overex-
pression results in cholesterol traf ﬁcking to endosomes/lysosomes ( Figure 2B ). The difference in cholesterol
localization between the overexpressed, KO, and L16P conditions suggest different cellular responses to these
genetic backgrounds and may partially explain their varying associated disease severities. Evidence also suggests
PMP22 interacts with directly with cholesterol through its CRAC motif and they may co-traf ﬁc and that this
trafﬁcking may possibly also involve MPZ facilitating enhanced traf ﬁcking through the Golgi. PMP22 associates with cholesterol-enriched domains
Further evidence for a direct relationship between PMP22 and cholesterol can be found by examining their
co-association with liquid-ordered membrane domains."

Thus, we examined sciatic nerve
extracts from Tr, as well as wild-type, Pmp22 -overexpressing
(Magyar et al., 1996 ), and homozygous and heterozygous Pmp22
knockout mice ( Adlkofer et al., 1995, 1997 ). NDRG1 phosphory-
lation was not heavily affected but appeared slightly reduced in Tr
(Fig. 2 C). To determine the cellular distribution of NDRG1 in sciatic
nerve, we immunostained teased fibers from adult rats withNDRG1 antiserum and a mouse monoclonal antibody againstmyelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). NDRG1 colocalized with
MAG in the paranodes, incisures, and the inner mesaxon of
myelin sheaths. NDRG1, but not MAG immunoreactivity, wasseen in the perinuclear region and abaxonal cytoplasm ofmyelinating Schwann cells ( Figs. 3 A and B). To investigate this
further, we examined longitudinal and transverse sections of thesciatic nerve and the nerve roots ( Figs. 3 C and D). In sections,
NDRG1 staining of the outer or abaxonal cytoplasm was more
apparent, in contrast to the MAG staining of the inner oradaxonal Schwann cell membrane."

transcription factors in response to both 10058-F4 as well as
MYCN- shRNA ( Fig. S3 A). The proteomic data were validated
using immunoblotting ( Fig. S3 B). Collectively, these data
show that 10058-F4 targets MYC signaling in NB cells. MYCN Inhibition Causes Respiratory Chain Impairment. To further
dissect how 10058-F4 in ﬂuences NB cell metabolism and conse-
quently causes lipid accumulation, we compiled all proteins in-
volved in respiration as well as carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid
metabolism found down-regulated in the two experimental set-
tings ( Tables S2 andS3). The majority of down-regulated met-
abolic proteins were those comprising the respiratory chain both
in response to 10058-F4 and anti- MYCN shRNA (Fig. 5 Aand
Tables S2 andS3), suggesting that these changes caused the
observed lipid accumulation. Interestingly, the levels of many
enzymes involved in catalyzing β-oxidation of fatty acids as well
as essential factors regulating the citric acid cycle and glycolysis
were also reduced after 10058-F4 treatment."

A consistent slow NCV of < 38 m/s in the
arms represents the demyelinating form of CMT1, whereas a value >38 m/s is distinctive
of the axonal form of CMT2. Transitional NCVs (25–45 m/s) are often observed in males
with CMTX1 and in patients with other transitional patterns of CMT [4]. The genetic diagnosis of CMT has been conducted by implementing the targeted next-
generation sequencing and whole-exome sequencing approaches. Over 120 gene mutations
are related to the pathogenesis of CMT and associated neuropathies [ 5,6]. The frequency of
the various types of CMT varies by region and the age at which they were published. In
the study by Saporta et al., 787 out of 1024 patients were diagnosed with CMT; a genetic
subtype was identiﬁed in 527 (67%) of these patients, while the remaining 260 patients did
not present with any identiﬁable mutation. Among the genetically deﬁned cases, CMT1A
(PMP22 ) emerged as the most prevalent subtype, comprising 55% of the cases, followed
by CMTX1 ( GJB1 ; 15.2%), hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP;

feebleness, atrophy, decreased sensory function, hyporeﬂexia, and skeletal malformations. Although the disorder progresses slowly and patients may require ankle–foot orthotics,
they generally maintain ambulation and experience no signiﬁcant impact during their life
span. Extensive research on PMP22 and its role in CMT1A has advanced our knowledge of
the illness and improved the potential therapeutic techniques [3]. 2.1.2. CMT1B (MPZ)
CMT1B accounts for 10% of the total CMT1 cases and arises from MPZ mutations,
located on chromosome 1q22-q23; the majority of the peripheral nerve myelin protein
is encoded by CMT1B. The role of Po protein as a homophilic adhesion molecule is to
enable myelin compaction [ 10].MPZ variants lead to the etiology of demyelinating neu-
ropathy CMT1B (OMIM 118200). Some mutations result in axonal neuropathy CMT2I/J
(OMIM 607677/607736) and the additionally critical juvenile-onset Dejerine–Sottas syn-
drome (OMIM 145900) and congenital hypomyelination neuropathy 2 (OMIM 618184)."

The only network in MYC HME cells
associated with metabolism was “lipid metabolism ”(IPA Network

that some of the most signi ﬁcantly altered canonical signalling
pathways (377 genes; FDR < 5%; Min. fold: 6.81) in MYC HME cellswere involved in lipid metabolism, including atherosclerosissignalling, LXR/RXR activation, and PPAR signalling (Fig. 2b, black
boxes). Gene expression analysis of an unbiased list of 163
different genes (Supplementary Table S4) associated with lipid
metabolism across TERT, MYC, and HER2 HME cells revealed asigni ﬁcant enrichment of upregulation in MYC versus TERT (1.4-
fold over all upregulated genes, p=5×1 0

representation of fatty acid metabolism genes in TNBC patients.10

LIPID DYSMETABOLISM CONTRIBUTES TO MYELIN DISORDERS
To summarize the relevance of myelin lipid physiology to human diseases, a
brief discussion regarding the interrelationship between myelin-related disorders
and lipid metabolism is next provided. Leukodystrophies highlight an intersection between lipid dysmetabolism
and myelin pathology
Hypomyelinating and demyelinating disorders known as leukodystrophies pro-
vide a genetic link between lipid metabolism and myelin maintenance, as their un-
derlying mutations commonly occur in genes directly involved in lipid metabolic
pathways ( Table 1 ). For instance, mutations affecting fatty acid oxidation in per-
oxisomes can lead to leukodystrophy. Loss of function of ATP-binding cassette
subfamily D member 1 (ABCD1) causes X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD),
one of the most common leukodystrophies. ABCD1 is a peroxisome lipid trans-
porter for VLCFAs, which require ABCD1 for import and subsequent degradation
in peroxisomes ( Figure 4 A).151,152VLCFA accumulation in the CNS following

Because neuronal upregulation of genes related to choles-
terol metabolism could be a general response to chronic myelinalterations, we analyzed transcriptional proﬁles of isolated
cortical neurons following acute experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) induction and following acute-phase(6 weeks of cuprizone) and chronic-phase remyelination
(12 weeks of cuprizone followed by 2 weeks of cuprizone with-
drawal, 12+2 weeks) ( Figure 2 D). During acute disease (EAE or
6 weeks of cuprizone), neurons consistently downregulated
gene expression related to cholesterol metabolism ( Figure 2 E). In contrast, during remyelination following chronic demyelin-ation in the cuprizone model, expression of genes involved in
cholesterol metabolism was increased ( Figure 2 E;Table S3 ). To test whether the upregulation of cholesterol synthesis geneswas functionally relevant, we determined the abundance of ste-rols by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry
(GC/MS) in the chronic remyelination paradigm."

The transcriptional program involved in the c-Myc-dependent downmodulation of the F-actin cytoskeleton remains to be determined, but it could be identified in the near future by comparing the tran -
scriptomes of c-Myc-expressing fibroblasts and parental cells. Given the availabil -
ity of inducible c- Myc knock-in mice, an 
interesting experiment in the future will be to verify whether the inactivation of c-Myc in vivo contributes to alterations in the F-actin cytoskeleton similar to those described here. This may be actually the case, because we have observed that the previously described rat c- Myc

cells display more robust and abundant stress fibers and focal adhesions than their wild type TGR-1 counterparts (Sauzeau V, Berenjeno IM, Citterio C and Bustelo XR, unpublished data).

acids, speciﬁcally bind to mRNA sequences, promoting their degradation in an RNaseH-
dependent manner. ASOs have been demonstrated to successfully conquer Pmp22 mRNA
in affected nerves in two murine CMT1A models; notably, starting ASO therapy following
the onset of the disease reestablished myelination, motor nerve conduction verocity, and
compound muscle action potential nearly to the levels observed in wild-type animals [ 77]. 3.3.3. CRISPR/Cas9
The CRISPR/Cas9 methodology focuses on manipulating regulatory elements in the
PMP22 gene to suppress its transcription. This technique was employed in a rat SC line to
excise an upstream portion of the Pmp22 gene, a region anticipated to contain an enhancer
or promoter for the gene; the elimination of this area resulted in a reduction in Pmp22
mRNA concentrations. The elimination of the TATA-box promoter from the Pmp22 gene in
C22 mice via CRISPR/Cas9 caused a downregulation of Pmp22 mRNA and improved the
nerve pathology [78]."
