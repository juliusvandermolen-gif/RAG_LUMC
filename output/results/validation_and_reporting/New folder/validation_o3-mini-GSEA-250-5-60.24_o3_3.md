## g:Profiler Comparison Summary
### Comparison of GPT-supplied pathways with gProfiler ground-truth list  

| Pathway (GPT List) | Validation (Hit/No Hit) | Novel or Common | Matched Pathway (gProfiler List) | Annotation Term (GO/KEGG/REAC) |
|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling | Hit | Common | Cell surface receptor signaling pathway | GO:0007166 |
| Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity | Hit | Common | Axon guidance | KEGG:04360 |
| Myelination & Glial Differentiation | Hit | Common | Myelin sheath | GO:0043209 |
| Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport | Hit | Common | Vesicle / Endomembrane system | GO:0031982 / GO:0012505 |
| Neurogenesis & Neural Development | Hit | Common | System development | GO:0048731 |

### Interpretative summary
1. **All five GPT-listed pathways register as hits.**  
   • Although names differ slightly, each GPT pathway aligns functionally with at least one gProfiler-identified term.  
2. **Biological relevance of the matches**  
   • Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling involves receptor-mediated signaling cascades driving synapse modification—captured under broad GO terms governing cell-surface receptor signaling and regulation of signaling.  
   • Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity directly overlaps with KEGG “Axon guidance,” a canonical pathway steering growing axons to targets.  
   • Myelination & Glial Differentiation corresponds to the GO category “myelin sheath,” reflecting genes contributing to oligodendrocyte maturation and insulation of axons.  
   • Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport intersects with vesicle trafficking and endomembrane organization terms that underpin cytoskeleton-dependent movement of organelles and cargos.  
   • Neurogenesis & Neural Development fits within the broad GO umbrella “system development,” encompassing neuronal lineage specification and tissue patterning.  

3. **No novel pathways were detected.**  
   Every GPT pathway has at least one representative term in the ground-truth list, suggesting good concordance between the user’s thematic grouping and gProfiler enrichment output.

Summary  
• GeneCards GO annotations support potential roles in neurogenesis/neural development for all listed genes.  
• Verified peer-reviewed literature supporting pathway involvement was found only for Nes (Nestin).  
• For Id2, Dyrk1a, Atf5, Klf9, Msi1, Peg3, Igfbp3, Lifr, Cxcl12 and Numb, no suitable, verifiable publications explicitly linking each gene to neurogenesis or neural development were located under the specified search constraints.  
• Consequently, while bioinformatic annotations hint at relevance, experimental confirmation from the academic literature remains unverified for most genes, indicating significant evidence gaps that warrant further investigation.
