Below is the evaluation of each user‐provided pathway compared with the ground truth list. For each pathway, a “hit” means that a similar or directly matching biological process is found in the ground truth. In cases where no equivalent term is detected, the pathway is flagged as “no hit” and considered novel relative to the provided ground truth.

Here is the tab‐separated summary:

Pathway	                  Validation (Hit or no hit)	Novel or not	          Matched Ground Truth Pathway
Axon Guidance and Neuronal Migration	    Hit	                    Not novel	            Axonal Guidance Signaling
Synaptic Function and Plasticity	        Hit	                    Not novel	            Activation of NMDA receptors and postsynaptic events
Myelination and Glial Development	        Hit	                    Not novel	            Myelination Signaling Pathway
Cytoskeletal Dynamics and Axonal Transport	    Hit	                    Not novel	            Kinesins; Regulation of Actin-based Motility by Rho
Extracellular Matrix Remodeling and Neural Cell Adhesion	    Hit	    Not novel	            Extracellular matrix organization; L1CAM interactions
Neural Growth Factor Signaling and Transcriptional Regulation   No hit	                Novel	
Ion Channel and Calcium Signaling	        No hit	                Novel

Interpretative Narrative:

The majority of the user‐provided pathways (five of seven) show strong overlap with key neurobiological processes in the ground truth. For example, the “Axon Guidance and Neuronal Migration” pathway is captured by the established “Axonal Guidance Signaling,” while “Synaptic Function and Plasticity” aligns with mechanisms involved in postsynaptic NMDA receptor activation. In addition, processes governing myelination, cytoskeletal motor function, and extracellular matrix organization are well represented in the ground truth.

However, two pathways—“Neural Growth Factor Signaling and Transcriptional Regulation” and “Ion Channel and Calcium Signaling”—do not have clear counterparts in the ground truth list. Although each of these topics is well studied in neuroscience, their absence from the provided ground truth suggests they might represent either an alternative perspective or underexplored/complementary aspects relative to the dataset’s focus. Researchers may find it useful to further examine these areas to determine if they add new insight or simply reflect common processes not included in the ground truth compilation.

Overall, the validated pathways demonstrate coherent functional themes in neural development and signal propagation, while the two novel entries might offer opportunities for deeper investigation.
