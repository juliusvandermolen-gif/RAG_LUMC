Below is the validation of your identified pathways against the ground truth. In this analysis, each user‐identified pathway (as listed below) exactly matches a corresponding entry in the ground truth dataset. All matches are marked as “Hit” and—as they are already established in widely used databases (GO, KEGG, REAC)—none appear to be novel. Note that while some terms (for example, “protein binding” or “cytoplasm”) are very general and may not deliver pinpoint mechanistic insight on their own, they are nevertheless well documented and common in standard annotation collections.

–––

In summary, every pathway you identified was found in the ground truth list, confirming that they are well established (“common”) in current biological databases such as GO, KEGG, and Reactome. These pathways span a diverse range of biological functions—from cell‐environment interactions (cell periphery and extracellular region) to complex developmental and signaling processes (axon guidance, embryo development, and enzyme-linked receptor signaling). Although some annotations (like “protein binding” or “cytoplasm”) are very broad and may be considered less focused for mechanistic insights, the overall coherence of the validated pathways underscores their biological relevance. No novel pathways were detected based on this comparison, suggesting that your findings are in strong alignment with prevailing knowledge in the field.
