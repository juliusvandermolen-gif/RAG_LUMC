showed that during development, lipid metabolism genes (including those of sterol metabolism) failed to
up-regulate in a CMT1A background compared with WT, suggesting a failure to engage lipid synthesis during
myelination. Lipidomics studies conducted on CMT1A rats and human serum samples [ 26] found that rat sciatic nerves
exhibited impaired sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism in which ceramides, sphingomyelins,
hexosylceramides, and sphingosine were all reduced in CMT1A samples [ 26]. An earlier study also found these
same lipid species to be reduced in CMT1A rat sciatic nerve myelin and also cholesterol, PC, and PG lipid
species [ 25,26]. The two studies tested regimens of lipid supplementation (by either adding lipids or various
components of different lipid biosynthetic pathways) and observed improvements in myelination. A transcriptomic analysis of C3 (CMT1A model) mice found that the most severely down-regulated genes
were those involved in cholesterol biosynthesis [ 27].

Chunk Text: Next, we asked whether the disease biomarkers identified in 
the C22 transcriptomic study can be confirmed in the CMT1A rat 
model. Consistent with findings in C22 mice, the mRNA levels of lipid biosynthetic genes such as Sc5d and Ugt8a were decreased in CMT1A rats, although to a lesser extent than in C22 mouse nerves. ASO6 treatment trended toward increased mRNA levels of these genes (Figure 3G). Furthermore, the mRNA levels of Id2  
and Bzw2  were significantly increased in CMT1A rats compared 
with WT rats and were substantially decreased following ASO6 treatment (Figure 3G). Finally, we sought to identify a target engagement biomarker 
in the CMT1A rats. Toward this end, we collected blood and foot -
pad skin biopsies from treated CMT1A rats. Although there was detectable rat Pmp22 mRNA in the blood, there was no change in Pmp22 levels following ASO6 treatment (Supplemental Fig -
ure 5E). The level of rat Pmp22 mRNA in the footpad (containing dermal nerves and Schwann cells) was significantly reduced in ASO6- compared with control-treated rats, suggesting this could serve as a biomarker of target engagement (Figure 3H).

subfamily D member 1 (ABCD1) causes X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD),
one of the most common leukodystrophies. ABCD1 is a peroxisome lipid trans-

Certainly! Let’s explore how overexpression of  PMP22 
(Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 ) could influence  MYC expression, considering mechanisms 
in cell biology and biochemistry . Backgroun d 
• PMP2 2 is a transmembrane glycoprotein primarily 
expressed in Schwann cells, contributing to myelin 
sheath formation. It is also involved in regulating cell 
growth, adhesion, and apoptosis. • MYC is a transcription factor that regulates genes

1. Altered Signaling Pathway s: 
• PMP22 is known to interact with signaling pathways, particularly those involving cell 
growth and differentiation. Overexpressi on may activate or inhibit signaling cascades 
like PI3K -AKT or MAP K. 
• These pathways can modulate  MYC expression directly or indirectly through upstream 
regulators such as  mTO R or transcription factors like  NF-κB.

Chunk Text: Mitochondrial Dysfunction Alters SC Lipid Metabolism
Homeostasis
The diverse etiology of mitochondrial neuropathies modeled by
Tfam-SCKO mice is consistent with the notion that the interac-tions of multiple pathological processes ultimately drive diseaseprogression. Therefore, we mined genes differentially expressed
in 2-month-old Tfam-SCKO nerves to search for additional
disease-causing processes. Interestingly, we found that lipid-related metabolic pathways were overrepresented in this set of
genes ( Figure 4 A), suggesting alterations in SC lipid metabolism
secondary to mitochondrial derangements. Indeed, qRT-PCRconﬁrmed that a number of genes that are critically involved in
lipid synthesis were downregulated in Tfam-deﬁcient SCs,
including fatty acid synthase ( Fasn ) and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-
glutaryl-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase ( Hmgcr ;Figure 4 B). More-
over, we found that acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphoryla-tion, which inhibits the activity of this enzyme ( Figure 4 C), was
increased 3-fold in 2-month-old Tfam-SCKO nerves ( Figures
4D and 4E).

Chunk Text: [ 1,2](Fig. 1)). These intricate metabolic pathways became
increasingly complicated in the genomic era after the identi ﬁcation of
multiple genes encoding enzymes that seemingly carry out the same
enzymatic reaction. While many of these enzymes are located in the ER,
as expected, the localization and membrane topology of some of the
lipid synthesizing enzymes remain puzzling. Moreover, as many of the
emergent enzymes are identi ﬁed and classi ﬁed by sequence homology,
it is not always clear which lipid substrates they use within the intact
cell. Good examples include the growing family of GPATs (glycero-3-
phosphate acyl transferases), which transfer fatty acyl chains to gly-
cerol-3-phosphate (G3P) as the ﬁrst step in de novo lipid synthesis. GPAT3 and GPAT4 are integral ER-resident membrane proteins,whereas GPAT1 and GPAT2 are localized to the outer mitochondrial
membrane [ 3,4]. Some of these enzymes, such as GPAT4 [ 5], are cri-
tical for triacylglycerol (TG) synthesis and lipid droplet (LD) biogenesiswhile others are involved in controlling phospholipid synthesis.

exposed to hypoxia for 48 h which was validated by an increase in the 
expression of the hypoxia-responsive protein, HIF1 α. Transcriptomic 
changes in hypoxia-exposed astrocytes interestingly revealed upregu -
lation of pathways involved in steroid biosynthesis. The upregulated 
genes included key enzymes of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway 
including HMG-coA reductase (HMGCR), mevalonate kinase (MK) and 
squalene epoxidase (SQLE). Cholesterol within the central nervous system is produced de novo, as 
cholesterol from the circulation cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Within the CNS, cholesterol is produced by astrocytes, neurons as well as 
oligodendrocytes with astrocytes serving as a source for cholesterol for 
other cell types during times of need [13]. Cholesterol is transported in 
the form of ApoE-containing lipoproteins. Astrocytes express ABCA1 for 
the efflux of cholesterol and form lipoprotein-like particles which are 
taken up by oligodendrocytes and neurons using LDL-receptor (LDLR), scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SRB1) or LDL-R related protein 1/2 
(LRP1/2) [14].

myelin inhibitors such as Id2 , Id4, and Ednrb  was also increased,

fact that apoE, in conjunction with apoA-I and LDL receptors, participates in a well-established lipid transfer system raised
the possibility that apoE is also involved in lipid transport in the injured nerve. In the present study of the crushed rat
sciatic nerve, a combination of techniques was used to trace the cellular associations of apoE, apoA-I, and the LDL
receptor during nerve repair and to determine the distribution of lipid at each stage. After a crush injury, as axons died
and Schwann cells reabsorbed myelin, resident and monocyte-derived macrophages produced large quantities of apoE
distal to the injury site.

the myelin proteome and impacts the axonal proteome to even a 
greater extent. There are almost three times as many differentially 
expressed axonal proteins as myelin proteins (Table 1), and the al-
terations between these axonal proteins show extensive complexity. Among the identified myelin proteins, we found a 4.3- fold highly 
significant (p  < 0.001) decrease in peripheral myelin protein 2 (PMP2) 
(Table 1), a gene that has yet to be examined in PMP22- linked neu-
ropathies. In normal nerves, the PMP2 protein is concentrated 
around densely myelinated axons (Yim et al., 2022), and mutations 
in this cytosolic glial gene cause demyelinating neuropathies (Motley 
et al., 2016). In agreement, cross- sections of sciatic nerves from 
Wt mice display the characteristic mosaic distribution of PMP2-  
positive myelinated axons, identified by immunolabeling for NF- M 
(Figure 4a). Analysis of age- matched P21 TrJ mouse sciatic nerves is 
consistent with the proteomic data and shows an overall reduction 
PMP2- like reactivity around NF- positive axons (Figure 4b).

cle (Figure 3D). CMT1A rat nerves had unmyelinated axons great -
er than 1 micron in diameter even at 5 weeks of age (12) prior to 
onset of the treatment at 6 weeks.

significantly different (Figure 3, E and F).

further studies are required to better understand the role of SC for se-
lective axonal pathfinding and regeneration (Bolívar et al., 2020 ; 
Brushart et al., 2013 ; Contreras et al., 2022 ). Notably, in zebrafish 
mutants lacking SCs, regenerating axons grow at similar rates to wild 
types despite following erroneous paths (Rosenberg et al., 2014 ), sug-
gesting that SCs might be rather involved in the guidance of regrowing 
axons than in the regulation of their growth rate (Gonzalez and Allende, 
2021 ). Indeed, SC-derived signals, including the glycosyltransferase 
IH3, an enzyme involved in collagen and ECM modification, have been 
shown to promote target selective regeneration of axons after injury in 
zebrafish (Isaacman-Beck et al., 2015 ; Murphy et al., 2022 ).

Chunk Text: This also implies reversibility of the symptoms, since unmyelinated axons are apparent in the CMT1A rat model even at 5 weeks of age (12). Therefore, dramatic improvement is observed with cellular, elec-
trophysiological, and functional measures of peripheral neuropa -
thy. Despite the promising results, there remain several important questions, including whether sustained treatment will lead to continued improvement, whether it will prevent axonal loss, and whether it will work in older animals, in which axonal loss con-tributes to clinical manifestation (49). Future work will also be required to determine optimal dosing route and frequency as well as detailed characterization of ASO pharmacokinetic and pharma -
codynamic properties in peripheral nerves. In addition to the improvements induced by ASOs, these stud-
ies also afforded the opportunity to perform an RNA-seq profile of the C22 model, which identified several genes that were previous-ly shown to be upregulated in CMT1A models (c-Jun , Pou3f1, and 
Cxcl14 ) and also those that are downregulated (lipid biosynthetic 
genes and other myelin-related genes).

Chunk Text: 6A). Further, in the developing rat sciatic nerve, a striking
parallel between NDRG1 and PMP22 mRNA ( Snipes et al.,
1992 ) expression was found ( Fig. 6 B)—their levels rise sharply
soon after birth, remain high throughout the major myelination
period (P8-P20), and decline in the adult nerve (P120). Many myelin-related genes show this pattern of expression in
developing nerves. This expression typically depends on the
integrity of axon–Schwann cell interactions, which can be
experimentally disrupted by nerve injury ( Scherer and Salzer,
2001 ). Thus, we examined the expression of NDRG1 mRNA in
adult rat sciatic nerves that were either transected (to cause axonal
degeneration and to prevent axonal regeneration) or crushed (to
cause axonal degeneration but allow axonal regeneration and henceremyelination of regenerated axons). As shown in Fig. 7 A,
NDRG1 mRNA levels were strongly reduced distal to the injury
by 4 days posttransection and remained low even 2 months later.After nerve crush ( Fig.

Chunk Text: The ﬁnding that dietary cholesterol
supplementation also supports myelin repair ( Berghoff et al.,
2017b ;Saher et al., 2012 ) suggests that endogenous cholesterol
synthesis is insufﬁcient for complete remyelination. In the currentstudy, we provide evidence that neuronal cholesterol synthesis
is essential for repair of chronically demyelinated lesions. Neuronal cholesterol synthesis during remyelination
Following chronic demyelination, we found impaired remyelina-
tion in animals lacking neuronal cholesterol synthesis. In agree-ment, neuronal expression of cholesterol synthesis genes isincreased in human non-lesion MS tissue and following chronic
experimental demyelination. In neuronal mutants of cholesterol
synthesis, but not in corresponding oligodendroglial mutants,we showed a marked reduction in the density of oligodendrocyte
lineage cells. This ﬁnding points to an inference with repair that
precedes myelin membrane synthesis, likely in OPC proliferationand oligodendrocyte differentiation.

Chunk Text: Thus, MYC appears to regulate the genes involved sequentially
in lipid synthesis: ﬁrst inducing glucose and glutamine andthen FA synthesis associated genes. By RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq), increasing levels of MYC elicited the nonlinear induc-
tion of mRNA of glycolysis ( Figure S2 A), glutaminolysis ( Fig-
ure S2 B), and FA synthesis ( Figure S2 C). Third, we found that MYC binds to the promoters of choles-
terol biosynthesis genes ( Figures S1 C and S1D), induces key
enzyme for cholesterol biosynthesis ( Figure S2 C), and regulates
SREBP1 (Figure S2 D). Further, MYC regulates both SREBP1
andSCAP in BCL and HCC, as seen by mRNA expression by
RNA-seq ( Figure S2 D) and by protein analysis by western
blot ( Figure S2 E). This indicates that MYC’s regulation of lipo-
genesis is both through direct binding as well as through
SREBP1. Fourth, our results implicated that SREBP1 regulates FA syn-
thesis genes in the presence of MYC ( Figures S1 E and S1F). To
determine whether FA synthesis can be run by MYC indepen-dent of SREBP1, we knocked down SREBP1, through small
interfering RNA (siRNA) in a readily transfectable cell line,
EC4, a MYC-induced HCC cell line ( Beer et al., 2004 ).

outer membrane protein that has a key role in mitochon-
drial ﬁssion [ 22]. Indeed, overexpression of GDAP1
promotes fragmentation of mitochondria, whereas either
knockdown of GDAP1 or overexpression of a disease-re-lated mutant of GDAP1 causes mitochondria to assume an
elongated structure in vitro [ 22]. Although most genes
associated with mitochondria-related CMT are mainlyexpressed in neurons, GDAP1 is expressed both in myeli-
nating SCs and neurons [ 22]. Niemann and colleagues have
recently shown that myelinating SC-speciﬁc Gdap1 dele-
tion in mice results in decreased conduction velocity and
hypomyelination in the sciatic nerve, whereas motor neu-ron-speciﬁc Gdap1 deletion does not affect conduction
velocity and the structure of myelin [ 23], suggesting that
SC mitochondria without normal GDAP1 activity arelikely to be involved in the progression of peripheral
neuropathy.

Chunk Text: Here, we identify the regulatoryrole of MYC in FA synthesis. FA synthesis in normal cells is regulated by transcription fac-
tors called sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs)
(Lewis et al., 2011; Shao and Espenshade, 2014 ), which consist
of two splice variants of SREBP1, SREBP1a and SREBP1c, and
SREBP2. SREBPs are synthesized as precursors anchored in
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Upon activation by diminishedcholesterol, the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) dis-
sociates SREBPs from the ER into the nucleus ( Shao and Espen-
shade, 2014; Swinnen et al., 2006 ), where SREBPs activate
lipogenesis genes ( Sun et al., 2015 ). SREBP1 activates fatty syn-
thesis genes, whereas SREBP2 activates genes involved in me-
valonate and cholesterol synthesis ( Li et al., 2016 ). In cancer
metabolism, in addition to SREBPs, other regulators such asmTOR, YAP/TAZ, XBP, and MondoA control lipogenesis ( Carroll
et al., 2015; Lewis et al., 2011; Santinon et al., 2016; Xie et al.,

in neurons leads to normal myelin development but to a late onset peripheral neuropathy with myelin degeneration [68].

Chunk Text: 7e,f), likely indicating enhanced remyelination. In
contrast, expression of LXR family genes, which inﬂuence OPC
differentiation36, was not affected by cholesterol (Supplementary
Table 1). The expression of growth factors involved in OPC survival,
proliferation, migration or differentiation28, including Igf1
(insulin-like growth factor), Cntf (ciliary neurotrophic factor),
Inhba (inhibin beta-A, also called activin beta-A) and Egf
(epidermal growth factor) was strongly increased (2–20 fold) by
cuprizone, but was not further regulated by cholesterol
supplementation (Supplementary Table 1). A set of genes
whose products are known to inhibit differentiation of OPCs,
such as Fgf2 (ﬁbroblast growth factor 2) and Pdgfa (platelet
derived growth factor alpha)37–39, was also strongly upregulated
by cuprizone (8–12 fold higher than untreated controls). Strikingly, the expression of these mitogens was attenuated
in cholesterol fed animals to levels only 3–8 fold higher than
in untreated controls (Fig.

Chunk Text: Animals . Adult C57BL/6J females of 8 to 10 weeks of age were pur-
chased from the Jackson Laboratory. C22 mice, which harbor 7 cop -
ies of a human PMP22 transgene (13), were obtained and generated 
by Taconic via a rapid expansion method. CMT1A rats, which harbor 3 copies of a mouse Pmp22 cosmid (12), were bred and maintained 
on the Sprague-Dawley background. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats of 
approximately 200 g were purchased from Envigo. Oligonucleotides. Synthesis and purification of all chemically puri-
fied ASOs were performed as previously described (53), and 16-mer chimeric (gapmer) phosphothioate oligonucleotides containing cEt 
groups at positions 1–3 and 14–16 were targeted to human/mouse 
PMP22 (ASO1), rat Pmp22 (ASO6), or a control. The sequences evalu-
ated are listed in Supplemental Table 2. Lead ASO identification. Approximately 500 ASOs were designed 
against the full human PMP22 or rat Pmp22 genes, respectively. Electro -
poration of ASOs was carried out using the HT-200 BTX Electroporator 
with ElectroSquare Porator (ECM830) voltage source at 140 V in 96-well 
electroporation plates (BTX, 2 mm; Harvard Apparatus).

Chunk Text: This study additionally found that blocking the innate
immunity complement system in C3 mice did not rescue cholesterol biosynthesis, nor did it improve motorfunction, ruling out a role for an immune cause in CMT1A pathology. More recently, C3 CMT1A mice and
human patient-derived induced CMT1A pluripotent stem cell SC precursors (iPSC-SCPs) were used to
examine lipid metabolism [ 28]. In lipidomic and transcriptomic experiments in C3 mice, decreased sphingoli-
pids and cholesterol and their corresponding biosynthetic genes were observed. This study also demonstrated
dysregulated transcriptional and lipidome networks in CMT1A iPSC-SCPs. Lipid metabolism gene expression
was altered compared with the isogenic (WT) condition. These changes correlated with decreased lipid speciesin the CMT1A iPSC-SCPs lipidomic analysis. Sphingomyelin was signi ﬁcantly decreased in the CMT1A
iPSC-SCPs. In summary, data from multiple studies in rat, mouse, and human derived CMT models demonstrate dysregu-
lated expression of numerous lipid biosynthesis genes including cholesterol.
