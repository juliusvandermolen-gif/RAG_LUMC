### Pathway Cross-Validation  

| Pathway (GPT List) | Validation (Hit / No Hit) | Novel or Common | Matched Pathway in gProfiler List | Annotation Term (GO / KEGG / REAC) |
|--------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling | **Hit** (functionally related; covers generic signaling terms) | Common | cell surface receptor signaling pathway; regulation of signaling | GO:0007166 ; GO:0023051 |
| Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity | **Hit** | Common | Axon guidance | KEGG:04360 ; GO:0048846 |
| Myelination & Glial Differentiation | **Hit** | Common | myelin sheath | GO:0043209 |
| Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport | **Hit** (related to intracellular transport machinery) | Common | vesicle; endomembrane system; regulation of cell motility | GO:0031982 ; GO:0012505 ; GO:2000145 |
| Neurogenesis & Neural Development | **Hit** | Common | system development; developmental process; neuron projection extension involved in guidance | GO:0048731 ; GO:0032502 ; GO:1902284 |

### Interpretative Summary
All five user-supplied pathways show biological or functional overlap with terms recovered by gProfiler, indicating they are **validated hits rather than novel findings**:

• Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling is encompassed by broad signaling categories (GO:0007166, GO:0023051) that regulate synaptic communication and plasticity.  
• Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity directly matches the KEGG Axon guidance pathway, a key mechanism for establishing neuronal circuits.  
• Myelination & Glial Differentiation aligns with the “myelin sheath” term, reflecting processes essential for rapid nerve conduction and glial cell maturation.  
• Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport maps onto vesicle trafficking and endomembrane system terms that supply the cytoskeletal infrastructure necessary for cell movement and cargo delivery.  
• Neurogenesis & Neural Development corresponds to multiple developmental GO terms, highlighting coordinated gene programs that produce and pattern neurons.

Because each GPT pathway finds at least one concordant term in the gProfiler output, no pathways remain unvalidated or uniquely novel relative to the ground-truth list.

Summary  
• GeneCards GO annotations link every queried gene to processes relevant to synaptic function or organization, providing preliminary support for their potential roles in “Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling.”  
• Verified peer-reviewed evidence explicitly tying each gene to synaptic plasticity/signaling was located only for MEF2C (Flavell et al., 2006, Science).  
• For Prss12, Synpr, Sipa1l1, Lrrtm3, Cntn6 and Efna5, no suitable peer-reviewed articles could be verified that explicitly demonstrate involvement in synaptic plasticity or signaling under the required criteria; therefore, their pathway association currently lacks direct literature support despite suggestive GO terms.

Summary  
• For all seven genes (Mpz, Mag, Pmp22, Prx, Drp2, Gldn, Mal) GeneCards lists GO terms directly related to myelination or axon ensheathment, providing bioinformatic support for their involvement in myelination & glial differentiation.  
• Peer-reviewed literature further substantiates six of the seven genes with clear experimental evidence; each cited study explicitly connects the gene to myelin formation, stability, or glial differentiation.  
• No major discrepancies were found between GeneCards annotations and literature evidence; both data sources consistently support participation of these genes in the Myelination & Glial Differentiation pathway.

### Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport
**Genes involved:** Tuba4a, Tubb4a, Kif1a, Septin4, Septin5, Pfn2, Rab10

Summary  
• Strong, concordant evidence from GeneCards GO terms and peer-reviewed literature supports involvement of Tuba4a, Tubb4a, Kif1a, Septin5, and Rab10 in cytoskeletal dynamics and/or intracellular transport.  
• For Septin4 and Pfn2, GeneCards lists relevant cytoskeletal GO terms, but no verified papers explicitly linking these genes to the specified pathway were located in PubMed/Google Scholar, indicating a current gap in published experimental support.

Summary  
• GeneCards GO annotations suggest potential roles for all listed genes in neurogenesis or broader neural-development processes.  
• Verified peer-reviewed literature was located only for Nes, firmly linking Nestin (NES) to neural stem-cell activity and neurogenesis.  
• For Id2, Dyrk1a, Atf5, Klf9, Msi1, Peg3, Igfbp3, Lifr, Cxcl12, and Numb, no peer-reviewed papers explicitly confirming involvement in neurogenesis or neural development were found under the required verification criteria. This represents a significant gap between GeneCards annotations and currently located experimental evidence.
