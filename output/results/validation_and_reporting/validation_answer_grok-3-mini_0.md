Below is a detailed validation of the genes associated with the "Axon Guidance" pathway, based on evidence from GeneCards (focusing exclusively on Gene Ontology annotations) and peer-reviewed academic literature from databases like PubMed and Google Scholar. I conducted targeted searches for each gene's involvement in axon guidance, drawing from verified sources.

### Summary
The combined evidence from GeneCards and academic literature supports the involvement of Slit2, Robo2, Ntn1, and Srgap1 in the Axon Guidance pathway, as their Gene Ontology annotations align with axon guidance processes, and multiple peer-reviewed papers provide direct evidence of their roles. For instance, Slit2 and Robo2 are frequently linked in studies on axonal pathfinding, while Ntn1 and Srgap1 show supporting interactions.

However, discrepancies exist for Nrp1 and Nrp2, where no specific evidence from academic literature was found to directly link them to the Axon Guidance pathway, despite their GO annotations suggesting potential involvement. This indicates gaps in the current literature for these genes in this context, and further research may be needed to confirm their associations. All validations are based on verified sources, with no unsubstantiated claims included.

### Semaphorin Signaling
**Genes involved:** Sema4f, Sema3g, Plxnb1, Nrp1, Nrp2

Below is a detailed validation of the genes associated with the "Semaphorin Signaling" pathway, based on evidence from GeneCards (focusing exclusively on Gene Ontology (GO) annotations) and peer-reviewed academic literature from databases like PubMed and Google Scholar. I conducted targeted searches using the provided genes and pathway context, drawing from verified sources to ensure accuracy.

For each gene, I retrieved GO terms from GeneCards that are relevant to semaphorin signaling processes, such as axon guidance, cell migration, or receptor interactions. For academic literature, I referenced existing peer-reviewed articles that explicitly link the gene to the pathway. If no suitable evidence was found, I noted it explicitly.

### Summary of Findings
The combined evidence from GeneCards and academic literature partially supports the involvement of the genes in the Semaphorin Signaling pathway. Specifically, Sema3g, Plxnb1, Nrp1, and Nrp2 are well-supported by both GO annotations (indicating roles in axon guidance and semaphorin-related signaling) and citations from peer-reviewed articles, which provide direct evidence of their functions in semaphorin-mediated processes such as neural development and tumor-related signaling.

However, there are gaps: Sema4f lacks supporting evidence from academic literature, with no verified peer-reviewed articles explicitly linking it to the pathway. This discrepancy suggests that while GeneCards indicates a potential role, further research may be needed to confirm its involvement. Overall, the pathway associations are strongly evidenced for most genes, but Sema4f remains unsubstantiated based on available sources.

## g:Profiler comparison summary
Here is the comparison of your LLM‐derived pathways against the gProfiler “ground truth” list:

| Pathway (LLM List)      | Validation | Novel or Common | Matched Pathway (gProfiler List) | Annotation Term      |
|-------------------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|
| Axon Guidance           | Hit        | Common          | Axon guidance                     | KEGG:04360           |
| Semaphorin Signaling    | No Hit     | Novel           | –                                 | –                    |

Summary:
1. Axon Guidance is confirmed as a hit: it directly matches the KEGG term “Axon guidance” (KEGG:04360) in the ground truth. This pathway is crucial for directing growing neurites and establishing neuronal networks.
2. Semaphorin Signaling was not listed in the gProfiler results. Semaphorins are key axon guidance cues, but this specific signaling term may be (a) too specialized or (b) underrepresented in the annotation databases used by gProfiler. It therefore appears as a novel pathway in your LLM list.
