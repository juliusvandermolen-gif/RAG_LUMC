The only network in MYC HME cells
associated with metabolism was “lipid metabolism ”(IPA Network

that some of the most signi ﬁcantly altered canonical signalling
pathways (377 genes; FDR < 5%; Min. fold: 6.81) in MYC HME cellswere involved in lipid metabolism, including atherosclerosissignalling, LXR/RXR activation, and PPAR signalling (Fig. 2b, black
boxes). Gene expression analysis of an unbiased list of 163
different genes (Supplementary Table S4) associated with lipid
metabolism across TERT, MYC, and HER2 HME cells revealed asigni ﬁcant enrichment of upregulation in MYC versus TERT (1.4-
fold over all upregulated genes, p=5×1 0

acyl-CoA metabolism, mitochondrial β-oxidation, and lipases. Our
ﬁndings agree with Camarda et al. who also reported a strong
representation of fatty acid metabolism genes in TNBC patients.10

phosphatidylcholine (PC) and cardiolipin contained longer, moreunsaturated fatty acyl chains compared to TERT cells (Supple-mentary Fig.

To obtain better insights into the under -
lying pathogenic mechanisms in CMT1A, we investigated the role of PMP22 duplication in cellular homeostasis in 
CMT1A mouse models and in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated into Schwann cell precur -
sors (iPSC-SCPs). We performed lipidomic profiling and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on sciatic nerves of two developing CMT1A 
mouse models and on CMT1A patient-derived iPSC-SCPs. For the sciatic nerves of the CMT1A mice, cholesterol 
and lipid metabolism was downregulated in a dose-dependent manner throughout development. For the CMT1A 
iPSC-SCPs, transcriptional analysis unveiled a strong suppression of genes related to autophagy and lipid metabol -
ism. Gene ontology enrichment analysis identified disturbances in pathways related to plasma membrane compo -
nents and cell receptor signalling. Lipidomic analysis confirmed the severe dysregulation in plasma membrane 
lipids, particularly sphingolipids, in CMT1A iPSC-SCPs. Furthermore, we identified reduced lipid raft dynamics, dis -
turbed plasma membrane fluidity and impaired cholesterol incorporation and storage, all of which could result from 
altered lipid storage homeostasis in the patient-derived CMT1A iPSC-SCPs.

How can PMP22  overexpression  change  MYC expression  as rationalized by chatGPT  
 
Certainly! Let’s explore how overexpression of  PMP22 
(Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 ) could influence  MYC expression, considering mechanisms 
in cell biology and biochemistry . Backgroun d 
• PMP2 2 is a transmembrane glycoprotein primarily 
expressed in Schwann cells, contributing to myelin 
sheath formation. It is also involved in regulating cell 
growth, adhesion, and apoptosis. • MYC is a transcription factor that regulates genes 
involved in proliferation , metabolism, and apoptosis. Possible Mechanisms Linking PMP22 
Overexpression to MYC Expressio n 
1. Altered Signaling Pathway s: 
• PMP22 is known to interact with signaling pathways, particularly those involving cell 
growth and differentiation. Overexpressi on may activate or inhibit signaling cascades 
like PI3K -AKT or MAP K. 
• These pathways can modulate  MYC expression directly or indirectly through upstream 
regulators such as  mTO R or transcription factors like  NF-κB.

Next, we asked whether the disease biomarkers identified in 
the C22 transcriptomic study can be confirmed in the CMT1A rat 
model. Consistent with findings in C22 mice, the mRNA levels of lipid biosynthetic genes such as Sc5d and Ugt8a were decreased in CMT1A rats, although to a lesser extent than in C22 mouse nerves. ASO6 treatment trended toward increased mRNA levels of these genes (Figure 3G). Furthermore, the mRNA levels of Id2  
and Bzw2  were significantly increased in CMT1A rats compared 
with WT rats and were substantially decreased following ASO6 treatment (Figure 3G). Finally, we sought to identify a target engagement biomarker 
in the CMT1A rats. Toward this end, we collected blood and foot -
pad skin biopsies from treated CMT1A rats. Although there was detectable rat Pmp22 mRNA in the blood, there was no change in Pmp22 levels following ASO6 treatment (Supplemental Fig -
ure 5E). The level of rat Pmp22 mRNA in the footpad (containing dermal nerves and Schwann cells) was significantly reduced in ASO6- compared with control-treated rats, suggesting this could serve as a biomarker of target engagement (Figure 3H).

Differential pathway activity analysis. To minimize the discovery 
of false positive effects, activity scores were computed only after fil -
tering out genes that were not expressed in a given cell type (defined 
as a nonzero detection rate ≥10%, see Supplementary Table 2 for a 
full list of expressed genes per cell type). For each pathway-cell type 
combination, pathway activity scores were modelled using a multivari -
ate linear model as follows: pathway activity ~β0 × APOE4 + β1 × amy -
loid + β2 × nft + β3 × age_death + β4 × msex + β5 × pmi. Here, APOE4 is a 
binary variable, encoding the presence of at least one E4 allele. Amyloid 
and nft are averages of continuous measurements of pathology across 8 
and 5 brain regions, respectively, as evaluated and reported by ROSMAP. Age_death is a continuous measurement indicating age at death, pmi 
represents the PMI (a continuous measurement) and sex is a binary 
variable encoding biological sex. β0 represents the additive effect 
of APOE4 (≥1 allele) on pathway activity, when accounting for other confounding variables that might be correlated with, and therefore 
explain, a portion of the variation observed in the activity of a pathway 
of interest.

Because neuronal upregulation of genes related to choles-
terol metabolism could be a general response to chronic myelinalterations, we analyzed transcriptional proﬁles of isolated
cortical neurons following acute experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) induction and following acute-phase(6 weeks of cuprizone) and chronic-phase remyelination
(12 weeks of cuprizone followed by 2 weeks of cuprizone with-
drawal, 12+2 weeks) ( Figure 2 D). During acute disease (EAE or
6 weeks of cuprizone), neurons consistently downregulated
gene expression related to cholesterol metabolism ( Figure 2 E). In contrast, during remyelination following chronic demyelin-ation in the cuprizone model, expression of genes involved in
cholesterol metabolism was increased ( Figure 2 E;Table S3 ). To test whether the upregulation of cholesterol synthesis geneswas functionally relevant, we determined the abundance of ste-rols by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry
(GC/MS) in the chronic remyelination paradigm.

commercial genetic laboratory. Genetic anomalies were detected in 18.5% (n = 3312) of the
total population. Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampliﬁcation
revealed that duplications (56.7%) or deletions (21.9%) in PMP22 were reported for most of
the positive results; next, mutations were detected in GJB1 (6.7%), MPZ (5.3%), and MFN2
(4.3%). GJB1 deletions and mutations in the residual genes were 5.3% of the anomalies. Of
the individuals presenting a positive genetic outcome in a CMT-related gene, 94.9% had a
mutation in one of the following four genes ( PMP22 ,GJB1 ,MPZ , orMFN2 ) [8]. Effective pharmacological treatments for CMT are currently lacking. This review dis-

A consistent slow NCV of < 38 m/s in the
arms represents the demyelinating form of CMT1, whereas a value >38 m/s is distinctive
of the axonal form of CMT2. Transitional NCVs (25–45 m/s) are often observed in males
with CMTX1 and in patients with other transitional patterns of CMT [4]. The genetic diagnosis of CMT has been conducted by implementing the targeted next-
generation sequencing and whole-exome sequencing approaches. Over 120 gene mutations
are related to the pathogenesis of CMT and associated neuropathies [ 5,6]. The frequency of
the various types of CMT varies by region and the age at which they were published. In
the study by Saporta et al., 787 out of 1024 patients were diagnosed with CMT; a genetic
subtype was identiﬁed in 527 (67%) of these patients, while the remaining 260 patients did
not present with any identiﬁable mutation. Among the genetically deﬁned cases, CMT1A
(PMP22 ) emerged as the most prevalent subtype, comprising 55% of the cases, followed
by CMTX1 ( GJB1 ; 15.2%), hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP;

Approximately 350 GO terms corresponding

correlating with nerve axon- related cellular components (Figure 2d). Additionally, nine of the top ten molecular functions enriched within 
the affected samples are associated with RNA and nucleic acid activi-

Astro -
cytes are also known to influence oligodendrocyte development by 
modulating the availability of growth factors and nutrients required for 
oligodendrocyte differentiation [4]. Astrocyte activation in response to 
CNS injury can have both protective and detrimental effects on overall 
neuronal survival and myelination [5]. In this study, we aimed to study 
the effect of hypoxia on astrocytes to delineate the pathways that could 
potentially impact oligodendrocyte maturation. Transcriptomic analysis of human fetal neural stem cell-derived as-
trocytes subjected to hypoxia demonstrated the upregulation of 
cholesterol biosynthetic pathways. These findings were validated by 
measuring the gene and protein expression of cholesterol synthetic and 
transport proteins in FNSC-derived astrocytes and in a cell line model. Astrocyte cholesterol content and efflux was also increased in response 
to hypoxia. However, premyelinating oligodendrocytes did not

In the cortex, con-
ditional inactivation of cholesterol synthesis in neurons or oligo-dendrocytes resulted in moderate upregulation of cholesterol
synthesis genes, possibly to compensate for the loss of choles-
terol synthesis in the affected cell type ( Figure 1 E;Table S2 ). In
contrast, in all conditional mutants, we observed a moderatebut consistent downregulation of expression related to choles-
terol metabolism in white matter ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and S1
H). Here, reduced expression of genes associated with cholesteroltransport was noted in all conditional mutants, particularly in
AcKO animals ( Figure 1 F). In agreement, sterol proﬁling revealed
only moderate alteration in conditional mutants ( Figure S2 A). Surprisingly, corpus callosum of OLcKO and NcKO mice re-
vealed a marked downregulation of genes related to the blood-
brain barrier (BBB). This was accompanied by upregulation ofa few inﬂammatory mediators with proﬁles being unique toeach mutant ( Figures 1 E and 1F). Interestingly, by biochemical
quantiﬁcation of BBB permeability, the reduced tight junction
gene expression was paralleled by increased CNS inﬂux of thesmall-molecular-weight BBB tracer sodium ﬂuorescein (NaFl;

Nonetheless, there is still no pharmacological treatment 
available for any CMT type. However, the landscape is rapidly evolving and several novel approaches 
are providing encouraging results in preclinical studies and leading to clinical trials. Areas covered : The authors review the most promising therapies under study and the ongoing/ 
planned clinical trials. Several approaches to address PMP22 overexpression underlying CMT1A, the 
most frequent subtype, are being tested. Gene silencing, targeting PMP22, and gene therapy, to 
introduce specific genes or to substitute or modulate defective ones, are being experimented in animal 
models. Compounds acting on ER stress, unfolded protein response, neuregulin pathways, phosphoi -
nositides metabolism, axonal transport and degeneration, inflammation, polyol pathway, deoxysphin -
golipid metabolism, purine nucleotide pool are potential therapeutic candidates for different forms of 
CMT and related neuropathies. Expert opinion : We are getting closer to find effective therapies for CMT, but are far behind the 
exciting examples of other genetic neuromuscular disorders.

These hFNSC-derived astrocytes were 
exposed to hypoxia for 48 h which was validated by an increase in the 
expression of the hypoxia-responsive protein, HIF1 α. Transcriptomic 
changes in hypoxia-exposed astrocytes interestingly revealed upregu -
lation of pathways involved in steroid biosynthesis. The upregulated 
genes included key enzymes of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway 
including HMG-coA reductase (HMGCR), mevalonate kinase (MK) and 
squalene epoxidase (SQLE). Cholesterol within the central nervous system is produced de novo, as 
cholesterol from the circulation cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Within the CNS, cholesterol is produced by astrocytes, neurons as well as 
oligodendrocytes with astrocytes serving as a source for cholesterol for 
other cell types during times of need [13]. Cholesterol is transported in 
the form of ApoE-containing lipoproteins. Astrocytes express ABCA1 for 
the efflux of cholesterol and form lipoprotein-like particles which are 
taken up by oligodendrocytes and neurons using LDL-receptor (LDLR), scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SRB1) or LDL-R related protein 1/2

Indeed, we are still with -
out any drug treatment for CMT and there is no major impact 
on real world coming from ongoing research, yet. Which are the reasons for the gap with the other neuro -
muscular disorders? There are several contributing factors. The 
peripheral nerves are intrinsically more difficult to study as 
compared to the muscles and even to the motor neurons: it is 
problematic to obtain nerve tissue to be studied and charac -
terized, Schwann cells and myelination studies are particularly 
challenging, and it is currently extremely hard if not impossi -
ble to obtain reliable Schwann cells from iPSCs. It is also 
arduous to target drugs and gene therapies to the peripheral 
nerves, particularly to correct Schwann cell defects. Other 
reasons are constituted by: the great genetic heterogeneity 
of this group of diseases, with about 100 genes and loci 
involved in CMT and related neuropathies; the great variability 
of disease expression, with different phenotype severity 708

However, while high-fat diet can partially compensate for a deﬁciency in fatty
acid synthesis in the CNS, in the PNS a high fat diet results in worsening of myelin defects when fatty
acid synthesis is impaired [ 110,111]. The mechanisms underlying di erential e ects in the CNS vs.
PNS remain to be determined. Taken together the current literature suggests that the uptake of fatty
acid may not be the primary pathway for myelin formation. However, the importance of fatty acid
uptake contributing to the energetic metabolism of myelinating cells and axonal trophic support is
still unclear. Finally, there is also new evidence that lipids could be provided to myelin cells by neurons. A recent study found that fatty acids are released by hyperactive neurons and can be taken up by
neighboring glia to protect neurons from fatty acid toxicity [158]. 11. Fatty Acid Oxidation
The nervous system has very high metabolic demands. Notably the CNS consumes 20% of
the body’s oxygen supply. While the metabolic requirements for neural activity have been well
characterized, the energetic requirement for myelin formation and maintenance, as well as the
mechanisms for energetic production in myelinating cells, are not well understood [ 159].

[25]. mRNA expression of both lipid catabolizing and anabolizing transcripts were affected. This study further
showed that during development, lipid metabolism genes (including those of sterol metabolism) failed to
up-regulate in a CMT1A background compared with WT, suggesting a failure to engage lipid synthesis during
myelination. Lipidomics studies conducted on CMT1A rats and human serum samples [ 26] found that rat sciatic nerves
exhibited impaired sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism in which ceramides, sphingomyelins,
hexosylceramides, and sphingosine were all reduced in CMT1A samples [ 26]. An earlier study also found these
same lipid species to be reduced in CMT1A rat sciatic nerve myelin and also cholesterol, PC, and PG lipid
species [ 25,26]. The two studies tested regimens of lipid supplementation (by either adding lipids or various
components of different lipid biosynthetic pathways) and observed improvements in myelination. A transcriptomic analysis of C3 (CMT1A model) mice found that the most severely down-regulated genes
were those involved in cholesterol biosynthesis [ 27].

ity, the abaxonal membrane of myelinated fibers is defined as a basolateral-like region, whereas the adaxonal membrane, SLI, paranodes and microvilli are considered apical-like regions [18, 19]. Schwann Cell Development
During early vertebrate development, neural crest cells delaminate from the neural tube, proliferate, and migrate to generate a broad spectrum of cell types including, among others, Schwann cells, melanocytes, sympathetic neurons, sensory neurons, and skeletal and connective tissues of the head [24– 26]. The cell fate largely depends from the region 
of origin of the neural tube from which neural crest cells migrate. These regions are defined in an anterior–posterior axis direction as cranial, cardiac, vagal, trunk, and sacral. In particular, Schwann cells, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons, sympathetic neurons, and satellite cells associated with sensory neurons, all originate from ventrally migrating trunk neural crest cells [27].

Atrend toward increased ROCK
expression hasalsobeen observed inPCpatients [10–12].Inastudy of
colorectal cancer, polymorphisms inROCKs were found tobeclosely
related totheprogression ofcancer [13,14].High expression ofROCKs
hasalsobeen detected inhepatocellular carcinoma [15].However, the
mechanism bywhich ROCK1 plays aroleinregulating tumor glucose
metabolism remains unclear. MYC family oncoproteins, particularly c-MYC, areindispensable
master regulators ofmetabolic reprogramming invarious cancer types,
including pancreatic cancer [16].Studies have shown that c-MYC can
participate intheregulation oftumor cellgrowth, cellcycle progression,
metabolism, angiogenesis andother processes. However, theaction ofc-
MYC alone does notseem tobethedecisive factor incancer. Instead, c-
MYC must exert synergistic orantagonistic effects onother oncogenes
andtumor suppressor genes toproduce aseries ofeffects [17].The
phosphorylation ofc-MYC atcertain sites governs itsactivation and
subsequent biological functions through thetranscriptional activation of
target genes thatarenecessary forcellgrowth, anditsphosphorylation
atSer62isessential foritsoncogenic activity [18].Previous studies
have revealed that ROCK1 plays acrucial role inregulating prostate
tumor growth through aninteraction with c-MYC [19,20].Therefore,
thecomplex roleofc-MYC inpancreatic cancer needs further study.

Longitudinal RNA-seq experiments [ 25] found that lipid biosynthetic processes (phospholipid, cholesterol,
and glycosphingolipid genes) were among the most prominently down-regulated transcripts in CMT1A rats
during postnatal development (for a complete list of genes see Supplementary Figure S1 of Fledrich et al.

These findings were consistent with the motor behavior and electrophysiology charac-terizations of the C22 cohort described in Figure 1. This was, to our knowledge, the first RNA-seq profiling of 
a CMT1A model, and the analysis showed some categories of 
genes in common with microarray profiles of other CMT1A mod-
els (34, 37 , 38). For example, there was a significant decrease in cholesterol and lipid biosynthetic genes as well as myelin-related genes in 5-week-old C22 compared with WT littermates (Supple -
mental Figure 2, C and F). The increased gene categories include a number involved in cell signaling, as well as those involved in axon guidance mechanisms (RhoA , Plxna1, and Rac1 ) and inte -
grin signaling (Itgb8 ) (Supplemental Figure 2D). Expression of 
myelin inhibitors such as Id2 , Id4, and Ednrb  was also increased, 
suggesting an unfavorable environment for remyelination (Sup -
plemental Figure 2E). Dysregulation of several transcription fac-tors regulating Schwann cell differentiation was also observed in the C22 mice (Supplemental Figure 2F).

In the outbred rat model of CMT1A,22rats can have varying 
levels of rodent Pmp22 expression, giving rise to a spectrum of pheno -
type severities, including variations in the expression of lipid 
metabolism-related genes.22,49To understand how these transcrip -
tional changes influence the CMT1A lipid profiles, we performed lipi-
domics on the sciatic nerves of 5-week-old C3 mice. Overall, the 
analysis revealed a major downregulation of lipid species in general, 
particularly of SPs, with SMs being the most affected in the sciatic 
nerves of C3 mice compared with their age-matched littermate con-
trols. In further support of these alterations, CMT1A rat sciatic nerve 
myelin exhibited significantly reduced levels of total cholesterol, PC, 
PE, plasmalogens, SM and ceramides.49
The correct PM lipid composition is essential for Schwann cells to 
interact with axons and to produce myelin, the multilamellar lipid- 
based structure. During Schwann cell lineage development, neural 
crest cells give rise to SCPs, which are guided to the most distal regions 
of the body by the extending peripheral axons.51Once interacting with 
axons, SCPs can differentiate into immature Schwann cells, which or-
ganize axons to be myelinated and non-myelinated in a process de-
fined as radial sorting.52To investigate the cellular origins of CMT1A 
lipid alterations, we developed a protocol to derive a Schwann cell lin-
eage from iPSCs.

Derived diameters were used to calculate the g ratio in 200 to 300 individual fibers per genotype and age (P5 mice: WT,  
n = 7; Pex7 -KO, n = 4; Gnpat-KO, n = 4; P15 mice: WT, n = 5; Pex7 -KO, n = 4;  in RCDP type 2 and type 3 patients should be informative. In Ref-
sum’s disease, the single defect in α–oxidation of phytanic acid is 
known to cause peripheral neuropathy (34). Previously, we identi-
fied a group of atypical RCDP type 1 patients with mild mutations 
in PEX7 and a Refsum-like presentation, which included retinitis pigmentosa and nerve hypertrophy (17). In addition to the accu-mulation of phytanic acid, these patients also had a defect in plas-
malogen synthesis. Based on our current findings, we propose that 
RCDP type 1 patients should also be investigated for defects in nerve conduction and pathology. In these patients, the peripheral neuropathy can be aggravated by the combined defect in plasmal-ogen synthesis and phytanic acid accumulation. In the present study, we analyzed the phosphorylation levels of 
several kinases involved in PNS development to understand how a defect in plasmalogens impairs Schwann cell differentiation and Schwann cell–mediated myelination.

High-abundance cell types were 
well represented across all of the donors, independent of AD diagnosis 
or genotypic background, with reproducible proportions in most cases 
(Extended Data Fig. 1l,m). Thus, downstream analysis focused on only 
high-abundance cell types. APOE4 pathway-level alterations
To broadly characterize the potential transcriptomic effects of APOE4 
on molecular processes, we considered Gene Ontology biological 
processes and performed differential pathway activity analysis. We 
aggregated gene expression values into pathway activity scores and 
estimated the effect of APOE4 on aggregate scores. Activity scores 
summarize the overall gene expression levels for genes in a given path -
way, improving the power to detect subtle changes in pathway activity 
(Methods). We compared APOE3/4 and APOE4/4 versus APOE3/3 scores 
using a multivariate linear model controlling for sex, PMI, amyloid, 
neurofibrillary tangles and age at death. A total of 486 candidate APOE4-perturbed molecular processes were identified (P  < 0.05), 
including cell-type-specific (404 pathways, affected only in one cell 
type) and broadly dysregulated (82 pathways, affected in at least two cell types) processes (Fig.

3A and Supplementary Fig. 2) and iPSC-derived 
Schwann cells (iPSC-SCs) (Fig. 3A) from a patient line, CS67i-CMT-n1, alongside its isogenic control iPSC line, isogenic-CS67i-CMT (referred to as ‘CMT1A’ and ‘isogenic’ lines, respectively) (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5
). The isogenic line contained one copy of PMP22 less, in com -
parison to its CMT1A mutant counterpart ( Supplementary Fig. 6).During differentiation, the iPSC colonies acquired a Schwann cell- 
like morphology, accompanied by the expression of key proteins 
marking the transitions from iPSCs to early neural crest cells, SCPs and, ultimately, Schwann cells (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Figs 2 
and 3). Moreover, we documented the temporal expression profile of 
genes essential to Schwann cell lineage development (Fig. 3C). We 
also observed that these iPSC-SCs were capable of producing myelin when co-cultured with mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons (Fig. 3D). Bulk RNA-seq indicated that the transcriptome of CMT1A and 
isogenic iPSC-SCPs was similar to that of neural crest progenitors 
(Fig.

In both cases, a single, continuous basal lamina covers 
these neuron-satellite glia units, which are separated from each other by 
connective tissue (Pannese, 2010 ). During development, SGCs are 
derived from neural crest cells and likely furthermore originate from 
boundary cap cells (Jessen and Mirsky, 2005 ; Marol et al., 2004 ). As 
SGCs share several similarities with SC precursor cells, they have been 
suggested to represent a population of developmentally arrested SCs 
(George et al., 2018 ). Though, other studies demonstrate a molecular 
profile more reminiscent to astrocytes (Avraham et al., 2020 ; Jager 
et al., 2020 ; van Weperen et al., 2021 ) and emphasize overlapping 
functions to astrocytes in the CNS (Hanani and Spray, 2020 ; Huang 
et al., 2013 ). However, satellite glial cells were shown to also express 
unique genes that are absent in SCs and astrocytes (Mapps et al., 2022 ). Recent RNA-sequencing studies identified a pronounced M. Bosch-Queralt et al. Neurobiology of Disease 176 (2023) 105952

We identify a number of strategies to reduce pTau in a
CE-dependent manner and ﬁnd that allosteric activation ofCYP46A1 is a neuron-speciﬁc CE-lowering strategy particularly
well tolerated by human astrocytes. Collectively, our data identify
a CYP46A1-CE-Tau axis as an early druggable pathway in AD. RESULTS
A Drug Screen in iPSC-Derived Human FAD Neurons to
Identify Compounds that Reduce pTau Accumulation
pThr231Tau is an early marker of AD pathology that correlateswell with cognitive decline ( Buerger et al., 2002; Luna-Mun ˜oz
et al., 2007 ). pThr231Tau accumulates in APP duplication
(APP
dp) iPSC-derived FAD neurons ( Israel et al., 2012 ). To iden-tify compounds that reduce pTau accumulation in these FAD
neurons, we screened a collection of 1,684 approved and
preclinical drugs for their efﬁcacy to lower neuronal pThr231Tau. For our screen, neural progenitor cells (NPCs; line APPdp1-6)
(Israel et al., 2012 ) were differentiated to neurons ( Figures S1 A
and S1B) for 3 weeks, replated in 384 well plates, and allowed
to mature for 2 weeks before treatment with compound at5mM for 5 days.

2 and 3 ). Although this pathway 
has not been fully dissected in our work, the available data are consistent with the idea that the establishment of cell-to-cell contacts engages both transcriptional and a post-transcriptional mechanisms that counterbalance the action of c-Myc (Fig. 3) . The transcriptional mechanisms 
restore normal integrin subunit mRNA expression levels whereas the post-tran -
scriptional routes impact on the stability of Pak1 protein ( Fig. 3) . Regardless of the 
mechanisms involved, it is worth noting that the biological program activated by cell-to-cell contacts is not related to the stimulation of contact inhibition path -
ways, because RhoA
Q63L/c-Myc-expressing 
cells are highly transformed and have lost completely that type of regulation. 19
Although the data presented in this 
Extra View article formally demonstrated the role of Pak1 and integrin subunits in the c-Myc-dependent biological program, the readers should keep in mind that many more proteins could be implicated in this process.

we treated 6-week-old CMT1A rats weekly for 12 weeks with PBS, control ASO (12.5 mg/kg), or ASO6 (12.5 mg/kg) and sacrificed the rats following electrophysiological testing performed 1 week in RT4-D6P2T cells and in vivo screening of ASOs in Sprague- Dawley rats and identified an active ASO (ASO6) that effectively suppressed rat Pmp22 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on mouse Pmp22 mRNA (Supplemental Figure 5,

It is also reasonable that modulating Nrg1-III 
activity may constitute a general therapeutic strategy to treat 
CMT that are characterized by de/dysmyelination. Recently 
genetic overexpression of Nrg1-III has been shown to ameliorate 
the neurophysiological and morphological parameters in 
a mouse model of CMT1B and stimulating Nrg1-III signaling by 
pharmacological suppression of the Nrg1-III inhibitor TACE also 
ameliorated the neuropathy [46]. The importance of the neur -
egulin pathway is confirmed by the notable finding that soluble 
Neuregulin1 type I promoted myelin repair after nerve injury 
and its administration to CMT1A rats improved their motor 
performance, increased the number of myelinated axons in 
sciatic nerves, and restored the reduced axonal caliber [47]. 2.8. CMT4B: other approaches
CMT4B1 and CMT4B2 are caused by loss-of-function mutations 
in the myotubularin-related 2 (MTMR2, CMT4B1) and MTMR13 
(also known as SBF2, SET binding factor 2, CMT4B2) genes, 
involved in the phosphoinositides (PIs) metabolism [48].

Haploinsufficiency of NRG1 type III in mice results in hypomyelination, reduced number of myelinated axons, and defective Remak bun-dles [61]. Vice versa, overexpression of NRG1 type III in the axon is associated with increased myelin thickness and ectopic myelination, that is myelination of bundles of axons, indicative of a hypermyelinating phenotype [62]. Altogether, these findings suggest that NRG1 type III is an instructive signal for Schwann cell myelination as not only dictates the fate of Schwann cells in the binary choice between myelina -
tion and non-myelination but also the amount of myelin that Schwann cells produce. Myelin thickness is a function of the amount of NRG1 type III exposed on the axonal surface and thus of the axonal diameter. NRG1 activity is regulated at post-translational level 
by secretases, notably β-secretase BACE1 and α-secretase TACE (TNF-alpha convertase enzyme or ADAM17, ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17), whose cleavage results in opposite outcomes [63– 65].

In addition, neural 
crest derived satellite glia maintain a tight communication with the 
soma of sensory, sympathetic, and parasympathetic neurons and neural 
crest derivatives are furthermore an indispensable part of the enteric 
nervous system. The remarkable plasticity of SCs becomes evident in the 
context of a nerve injury, where SC transdifferentiate into intriguing 
repair cells, which orchestrate a regenerative response that promotes 
nerve repair. Indeed, the multiple adaptations of SCs are captivating, but 
remain often ill-resolved on the molecular level. Here, we summarize 
and discuss the knowns and unknowns of the vast array of functions that 
this single cell type can cover in peripheral nervous system develop -
ment, maintenance, and repair. Abbreviations: c-JUN, c-JUN transcription factor; C3, complement component 3; CCL2, CC motif chemokine ligand 2; CNS, central nervous system; CR3, com-

Identification of 
a well- established marker of axonal disease, G3BP1, substantiates 
the notion that irrespective of the cellular origin of the neuropathy, 
the dynamic interplay between the axon and myelinated glia is per-
turbed early- on in affected nerves. This unbiased global proteomic study confirms our previous 
work on the involvement of degradative pathways in PMP22-  
linked neuropathies (Fortun et al., 2003; Notterpek et al., 1997). Since PMP22, the disease- causing protein, is prone to aggregation 
when mutated or overexpressed (Notterpek, Ryan, et al., 1999), 
the mistrafficked protein induces a proteostatic dysbalance (Fortun 
et al., 2003). Dysregulated proteins identified in this study include 
autophagy- related cathepsins B, C, D, and Z, lysosomal- associated 
membrane protein 2, and several other molecules that comprise the 
lysosome and proteasome pathways (Figures 5 and 6 ). Recent ev-
idence suggests that the close regulation of autophagy is directly 
related to the pathobiology of neurodegeneration and is linked 
to the clearance of intracellular waste in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, 
and Huntington's diseases (Song et al., 2021).

Patients carrying SORD mutations show very high levels of 
blood sorbitol, which, as shown in previous studies on diabetic 
neuropathy, may be toxic for the peripheral nerves. Inhibitors 
of aldose reductase, the enzyme converting glucose into sor-
bitol, were developed in attempts to treat diabetic neuropathy 
and they are being considered as candidates for therapeutic 
intervention to decrease sorbitol levels [56]. 2.14. Serine in hereditary sensory neuropathy type I
Hereditary Sensory Neuropathy type I (HSN1) is associated 
with mutations in the SPTLC1 and SPTLC2 genes, encoding 
subunits of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) enzyme 
catalyzing the first step of sphingolipids synthesis by con-
jugating palmitoyl-CoA and L-serine. HSN1 mutations reduce 
the affinity of SPT for L-serine and increase its affinity for 
alanine and glycine, leading to formation of neurotoxic 
1-deoxysphingolipids (1-deoxySLs). The levels of 1-deoxySL 
can be reduced in mice and humans by treatment with high 
doses of L-serine, the normal substrate of SPT.

1a and Supplementary Table 4). APOE4-dysregulated processes included upregulation of inflam -
matory and immune-related pathways in several cell types, includ -
ing NF-к B signalling in excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons and 
OPCs; T cell receptor and cytokine signalling in astrocytes; and 
tumour-necrosis-factor-mediated signalling in microglia and excitatory 
neurons (Fig. 1a). We also observed downregulation of synaptic-related 
processes, including ion channel activity, excitatory postsynaptic poten -
tial and synaptic plasticity (Fig. 1a). Notably, these alterations not only 
occurred in neurons (for example, voltage-gated calcium channel activ -
ity), but also in oligodendrocytes (for example, long-term neuronal 
synaptic plasticity). In APOE4 excitatory neurons, we identified upregu -
lation of ERK1/2 signalling (such as MAPK1 , MAP2K1  and MAP2K2 ) and 
endosomal-related transport (such as RAB21  and SNX12) genes (Sup -
plementary Table 4). All of these effects are consistent with the reported 
roles of APOE4 in inflammation, synaptic impairment, MAPK1 signalling 
and downstream APP transcription and early endosomes7,18.

Clinical translation is feasible due to the

3.2.1. Neuregulin-1 Type I (NRG1)
The peripheral myelination of the nerves is endorsed by axonal neuregulin 1 type
III (Nrg1-III) through downstream signaling pathways activation, such as PI3K/Akt and
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK, which ultimately regulate the master
transcriptional regulators of myelin genes, such as Krox20 [30]. The thickness of the
myelin is controlled by the amount of Nrg1-III, whose action is moderated by the secre-
tases -site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and tumor necrosis
factor- converting enzyme (TACE) through distinct extracellular cleavage mechanisms [ 9]. Niacin/Niaspan (nicotinic acid) may improve focal hypermyelination, avoid myelin deteri-

Some pathways were renamed for clarity and 
owing to space constraints in Fig. 1. New names are documented in 
Supplementary Tables 4–6. Pathway activity scores. Individual-cell-type-level normalized gene 
expression profile averages were first computed (normalized values 
were first computed using ACTIONet), followed by calculation of 
pathway activity scores, as previously implemented in the R package 
GSVA (v.1.42.0)41. In brief, GSVA estimates a normalized relative ex -
pression level per gene across samples. This expression level is then 
rank-ordered for each sample and aggregated into gene sets by calculat -
ing sample-wise enrichment scores using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov-like 
rank statistic. The following parameters were used to evaluate the GSVA 
function: mx.diff=TRUE, kcdf=c("Gaussian"), min.sz=5, max.sz=150. Activity scores computed this way accurately recovered cell type sig -
natures that were not recovered by equally sized randomly sampled 
gene sets (data not shown), suggesting that this approach captures 
transcriptomically encoded biological signals in snRNA-seq data.

Abstract
Myelin is a key evolutionary specialization and adaptation of vertebrates formed by the plasma membrane of glial cells, which insulate axons in the nervous system. Myelination not only allows rapid and efficient transmission of electric impulses in the axon by decreasing capacitance and increasing resistance but also influences axonal metabolism and the plasticity of neural circuits. In this review, we will focus on Schwann cells, the glial cells which form myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we will describe the main extrinsic and intrinsic signals inducing Schwann cell differentiation and myelination and how myelin biogenesis is achieved. Finally, we will also discuss how the study of human disorders in which molecules and pathways relevant for myelination are altered has enormously contributed to the current knowledge on myelin biology.
