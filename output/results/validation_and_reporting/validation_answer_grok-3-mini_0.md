## g:Profiler comparison summary
### Comparison of GPT-generated pathways with gProfiler results  

| Pathway (LLM List) | Validation (Hit / No Hit) | Novel or Common | Matched Pathway (gProfiler List) | Annotation Term (GO/KEGG/REAC) |
|--------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Axon Guidance and Neuronal Navigation | **Hit** | Common | Axon guidance; axon extension involved in axon guidance | KEGG:04360, GO:0048846 |
| Synaptic Formation and Plasticity | No Hit | Novel | — | — |
| Myelination and Node Organization | **Hit** | Common | Myelin sheath; Schmidt-Lanterman incisure | GO:0043209, GO:0043220 |
| Extracellular Matrix and Cell Adhesion in Neural Development | **Hit** | Common | Extracellular matrix organization; cell adhesion | REAC:R-RNO-1474244, GO:0007155 |

| Calcium and Ion Channel Signaling | No Hit | Novel | — | — |

### Interpretative Summary  
Validated (hit) pathways show strong or plausible correspondence with gProfiler terms:  
• Axon guidance is directly present, underscoring mechanisms steering growing axons toward their targets.  
• Myelination pathways match “myelin sheath” and related structures, highlighting Schwann/oligodendrocyte functions.  
• Extracellular-matrix & cell-adhesion processes align with multiple ECM and adhesion annotations, critical for neural tissue architecture.  
• Wnt/planar-cell-polarity signaling is not listed verbatim, but maps loosely to “cell surface receptor signaling” and “system development,” both umbrella categories encompassing canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling in development.

Non-validated (no-hit) pathways:  
• Synaptic formation & plasticity and Calcium/ion-channel signaling were not retrieved by gProfiler. Their absence may reflect (i) gene sets lacking sufficient enrichment signal for classical synaptic or calcium channel GO terms in the analyzed data, (ii) these processes being distributed across broader annotations (e.g., “response to stimulus”) that did not pass reporting thresholds, or (iii) specificity to neural sub-processes under-represented in current GO/Reactome categories.
