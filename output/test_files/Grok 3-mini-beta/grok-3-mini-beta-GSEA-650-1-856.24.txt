Ter  Back to the initial pathways, I need to ensure I only list pathways with genes from the user's list. My previous response has too many "Not matched" entries, which isn't allowed as per instructions. I must only include pathways that have at least some associated genes from the list.

Refine to biologically meaningful pathways with genes:

- Axon Guidance Pathway: Sema4f, Nrp1, Nrp2, Slit2, Robo2, Plxnb1, Dpysl5, Cntn6

- Myelin Sheath Assembly: Mag, Mpz, Plp1, Mbp, Hapln1, Col9a3

- Synaptic Plasticity Pathway: Bdnf, Sncg, Synpr, Cxcl12

- Wnt Signaling Pathway: Wnt5a, Lef1

- MAPK Signaling Pathway: Mapk1, Map2k6

- cAMP Signaling Pathway: Prkar2b

- Glycosaminoglycan Biosynthesis: Chst2, Hs6st2, Hs6st1

- Glycolysis / Gluconeogenesis: Eno1, Pfkp, Pfkl

- Fatty Acid Metabolism: Hadhb, Echs1, Hadha

- Calcium Signaling Pathway: Itpr, P2ry2

Present only those with genes, in the format.

Hist  I am considering that the response should only include pathway names and associated genes without any additional text. My previous output has narrative elements like "Not matched," which violates the instructions. I need to strictly adhere to listing only pathways with genes from the user's list and no explanations.

Corrected approach: Only include pathways that have at least one gene from the list, and list the genes comma-separated.
