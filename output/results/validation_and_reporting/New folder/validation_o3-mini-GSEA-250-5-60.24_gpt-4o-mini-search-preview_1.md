- **Septin4 and Septin5:** Both genes are associated with microtubule motor activity, and studies indicate that SEPT9 enhances KIF1A motility along microtubules, implicating these septins in cytoskeletal dynamics.

- **Pfn2:** No evidence was found linking this gene to cytoskeletal dynamics and intracellular transport.

- **Rab10:** Associated with microtubule motor activity, Rab10's role in axonal transport is supported by literature indicating that its knockdown or overexpression inhibits autophagosome and lysosomal motility along axons.

In conclusion, the involvement of Tuba4a, Tubb4a, Kif1a, Septin4, Septin5, and Rab10 in the 'Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport' pathway is well-supported by both GeneCards annotations and peer-reviewed academic literature.
