Thus, by analogy with epithelial cell polar -
ity, the abaxonal membrane of myelinated fibers is defined as a basolateral-like region, whereas the adaxonal membrane, SLI, paranodes and microvilli are considered apical-like regions [18, 19]. Schwann Cell Development
During early vertebrate development, neural crest cells delaminate from the neural tube, proliferate, and migrate to generate a broad spectrum of cell types including, among others, Schwann cells, melanocytes, sympathetic neurons, sensory neurons, and skeletal and connective tissues of the head [24– 26]. The cell fate largely depends from the region 
of origin of the neural tube from which neural crest cells migrate. These regions are defined in an anterior–posterior axis direction as cranial, cardiac, vagal, trunk, and sacral. In particular, Schwann cells, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons, sympathetic neurons, and satellite cells associated with sensory neurons, all originate from ventrally migrating trunk neural crest cells [27].

●Compounds preventing axonal degeneration or rescuing altered axo-
nal transport have the potentiality to cure many hereditary neuro -
pathies irrespective of the primary triggering defect: this is the case 
for the inhibitors of SARM1 and of HDAC6, an active field of research. ●Intervention on more specific metabolic pathways is also promising, 
such as for L-Serine to treat HSN1 by reducing neurotoxic deoxy -
sphingolipids, or compounds acting on the PYKfive enzyme in the 
phosphoinositides metabolism in CMT4B, or S-adenosylmethionine 
(SAM) to supply purine nucleotides in CMTX5 and its allelic disorders. ●Mutations in sorbitol dehydrogenase has been very recently asso -
ciated with a relatively common form of CMT2/dHMN and high levels 
of sorbitol. Inhibitors of aldose reductase, developed in the past for 
diabetic neuropathy, are good candidates for its treatment. Table 1. List of CMT genes associated with the different types of CMT and related neuropathies. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and related neuropathies

Feedback Loops and MicroRNA Regulatio n: 
• MYC expression is tightly regulated by feedback loops and microRNAs. PMP22 may alter 
the expression of specific microRNAs that target MYC, such as  let-7 or miR-34a, 
thereby affecting MYC levels . Experimental Validatio n 
 
To establish a causal relationship, you could:  
• Use Western blottin g or qPC R to measure MYC expression after PMP22 overexpression . • Apply  pharmacological inhibitor s or genetic tools (e.g., CRISPR) to block suspected 
signaling pat hways and observe changes in MYC expression . • Assess the role of ER stress markers (e.g., CHOP, BiP) to link PMP22 overexpression to 
UPR . By understanding these mechanisms, you might 
uncover novel insights into cellular stress, growth, and

genes essential to Schwann cell lineage development (Fig. 3C). We 
also observed that these iPSC-SCs were capable of producing myelin when co-cultured with mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons (Fig. 3D). Bulk RNA-seq indicated that the transcriptome of CMT1A and 
isogenic iPSC-SCPs was similar to that of neural crest progenitors

How can PMP22  overexpression  change  MYC expression  as rationalized by chatGPT  
 
Certainly! Let’s explore how overexpression of  PMP22 
(Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 ) could influence  MYC expression, considering mechanisms 
in cell biology and biochemistry . Backgroun d 
• PMP2 2 is a transmembrane glycoprotein primarily 
expressed in Schwann cells, contributing to myelin 
sheath formation. It is also involved in regulating cell 
growth, adhesion, and apoptosis. • MYC is a transcription factor that regulates genes 
involved in proliferation , metabolism, and apoptosis. Possible Mechanisms Linking PMP22 
Overexpression to MYC Expressio n 
1. Altered Signaling Pathway s: 
• PMP22 is known to interact with signaling pathways, particularly those involving cell 
growth and differentiation. Overexpressi on may activate or inhibit signaling cascades 
like PI3K -AKT or MAP K. 
• These pathways can modulate  MYC expression directly or indirectly through upstream 
regulators such as  mTO R or transcription factors like  NF-κB.

genes ( PMP22 ,GJB1 ,MPZ ,MFN2 ,SH3TC2 ,GDAP1 ,NEFL ,LITAF ,GARS ,HSPB1 ,FIG4 ,
EGR2 ,PRX , and RAB7A ) related to CMT in a cohort study of 17,880 patients tested in a
commercial genetic laboratory. Genetic anomalies were detected in 18.5% (n = 3312) of the
total population. Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampliﬁcation
revealed that duplications (56.7%) or deletions (21.9%) in PMP22 were reported for most of
the positive results; next, mutations were detected in GJB1 (6.7%), MPZ (5.3%), and MFN2
(4.3%). GJB1 deletions and mutations in the residual genes were 5.3% of the anomalies. Of
the individuals presenting a positive genetic outcome in a CMT-related gene, 94.9% had a
mutation in one of the following four genes ( PMP22 ,GJB1 ,MPZ , orMFN2 ) [8]. Effective pharmacological treatments for CMT are currently lacking. This review dis-
cusses the treatment of CMT with the four main causative genes.

Astro -
cytes are also known to influence oligodendrocyte development by 
modulating the availability of growth factors and nutrients required for 
oligodendrocyte differentiation [4]. Astrocyte activation in response to 
CNS injury can have both protective and detrimental effects on overall 
neuronal survival and myelination [5]. In this study, we aimed to study 
the effect of hypoxia on astrocytes to delineate the pathways that could 
potentially impact oligodendrocyte maturation. Transcriptomic analysis of human fetal neural stem cell-derived as-
trocytes subjected to hypoxia demonstrated the upregulation of 
cholesterol biosynthetic pathways. These findings were validated by 
measuring the gene and protein expression of cholesterol synthetic and 
transport proteins in FNSC-derived astrocytes and in a cell line model. Astrocyte cholesterol content and efflux was also increased in response 
to hypoxia. However, premyelinating oligodendrocytes did not

However, while high-fat diet can partially compensate for a deﬁciency in fatty
acid synthesis in the CNS, in the PNS a high fat diet results in worsening of myelin defects when fatty
acid synthesis is impaired [ 110,111]. The mechanisms underlying di erential e ects in the CNS vs.
PNS remain to be determined. Taken together the current literature suggests that the uptake of fatty
acid may not be the primary pathway for myelin formation. However, the importance of fatty acid
uptake contributing to the energetic metabolism of myelinating cells and axonal trophic support is
still unclear. Finally, there is also new evidence that lipids could be provided to myelin cells by neurons. A recent study found that fatty acids are released by hyperactive neurons and can be taken up by
neighboring glia to protect neurons from fatty acid toxicity [158]. 11. Fatty Acid Oxidation
The nervous system has very high metabolic demands. Notably the CNS consumes 20% of
the body’s oxygen supply. While the metabolic requirements for neural activity have been well
characterized, the energetic requirement for myelin formation and maintenance, as well as the
mechanisms for energetic production in myelinating cells, are not well understood [ 159].

To obtain better insights into the under -
lying pathogenic mechanisms in CMT1A, we investigated the role of PMP22 duplication in cellular homeostasis in 
CMT1A mouse models and in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated into Schwann cell precur -
sors (iPSC-SCPs). We performed lipidomic profiling and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on sciatic nerves of two developing CMT1A 
mouse models and on CMT1A patient-derived iPSC-SCPs. For the sciatic nerves of the CMT1A mice, cholesterol 
and lipid metabolism was downregulated in a dose-dependent manner throughout development. For the CMT1A 
iPSC-SCPs, transcriptional analysis unveiled a strong suppression of genes related to autophagy and lipid metabol -
ism. Gene ontology enrichment analysis identified disturbances in pathways related to plasma membrane compo -
nents and cell receptor signalling. Lipidomic analysis confirmed the severe dysregulation in plasma membrane 
lipids, particularly sphingolipids, in CMT1A iPSC-SCPs. Furthermore, we identified reduced lipid raft dynamics, dis -
turbed plasma membrane fluidity and impaired cholesterol incorporation and storage, all of which could result from 
altered lipid storage homeostasis in the patient-derived CMT1A iPSC-SCPs.

Schwann cells express Sox10 at all stages of development 
as early as in migratory neural crest cells before lineage specification, thus suggesting that Sox10 is a key determi-nant of Schwann cell identity [41, 42]. Sox10 is also crucial 
in terminal differentiation and in myelin maintenance, as it controls the expression of several myelin genes encoding P0, MBP, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and Cx32 [33]. Conditional deletion in adult nerves showed that Sox10 
is also required for myelin homeostasis to maintain myelin integrity [43]. In mutant mice lacking Oct6, myelin genes are repressed 
and myelination is blocked [44, 45]. A double Oct6/Brn2  
KO model shows a more severe phenotype as compared to single Oct6 KO, thus suggesting that these factors cooperate 
to promote the transition to a myelinating phenotype. Even if more severe than the single KO, in Oct6/Brn2, double KO myelination is delayed but not completely blocked [46]. This finding led to the hypothesis that another factor such as Brn1 can in part compensate loss of Oct6 in vivo [47].

CMT1A duplication), sometimes even within the same family; 
the slow disease progression in many CMT cases, which is 
good for the patients but makes it difficult to measure wor -
sening in natural history studies and assess benefit from 
tested treatments; and the rarity of the majority of CMT 
types, a challenge for studies on pathomechanisms and clin-
ical trials. Therefore, there is still a lot of work to do with 
preclinical and clinical studies before effective treatments 
become available for many CMT forms. From the preclinical standpoint, it is important to work on 
reliable animal models reproducing the disease as close as 
possible. There are many novel available models, particularly 
rodents, but flies and zebrafishes are also gaining popularity 
because they allow cheaper and more rapid studies with 
greater animal numbers; the use of patient-specific iPSCs to 
derive neural cells constitutes a major advance to understand 
pathogenic mechanisms of disease and to test potential ther -
apeutic compounds [61].

A Drug Screen in iPSC-Derived Human FAD Neurons to
Identify Compounds that Reduce pTau Accumulation
pThr231Tau is an early marker of AD pathology that correlateswell with cognitive decline ( Buerger et al., 2002; Luna-Mun ˜oz
et al., 2007 ). pThr231Tau accumulates in APP duplication
(APP

neurons, we screened a collection of 1,684 approved and
preclinical drugs for their efﬁcacy to lower neuronal pThr231Tau. For our screen, neural progenitor cells (NPCs; line APPdp1-6)
(Israel et al., 2012 ) were differentiated to neurons ( Figures S1 A
and S1B) for 3 weeks, replated in 384 well plates, and allowed
to mature for 2 weeks before treatment with compound at5mM for 5 days.

In both cases, a single, continuous basal lamina covers 
these neuron-satellite glia units, which are separated from each other by 
connective tissue (Pannese, 2010 ). During development, SGCs are 
derived from neural crest cells and likely furthermore originate from 
boundary cap cells (Jessen and Mirsky, 2005 ; Marol et al., 2004 ). As 
SGCs share several similarities with SC precursor cells, they have been 
suggested to represent a population of developmentally arrested SCs 
(George et al., 2018 ). Though, other studies demonstrate a molecular 
profile more reminiscent to astrocytes (Avraham et al., 2020 ; Jager 
et al., 2020 ; van Weperen et al., 2021 ) and emphasize overlapping 
functions to astrocytes in the CNS (Hanani and Spray, 2020 ; Huang 
et al., 2013 ). However, satellite glial cells were shown to also express 
unique genes that are absent in SCs and astrocytes (Mapps et al., 2022 ). Recent RNA-sequencing studies identified a pronounced M. Bosch-Queralt et al. Neurobiology of Disease 176 (2023) 105952

The intracellular domain of dystroglycan interacts 
with DRP2 and L-PRX. DG (dystroglycan) conditional KO in Schwann cells display a neuropathic phenotype morpho-logically characterized by irregular folding of myelin, dis-organization of microvilli, and consequent altered clustering of 
 Na+ channels at the node [14]. These features are not 
typical of laminin mutants and their receptors in develop-ment such as β1 integrin, suggesting that this phenotype is not due to altered ECM-Schwann cell communication. One hypothesis is that loss of function of proteins within the DG complex in Schwann cells leads to myelin instability [14]. DRP2 and L-PRX anchor DG in the Schwann cell apposi-tions, which defines the boundaries of the cytoplasm-filled adjacent regions, the Cajal bands (Fig. 1b, d) [13, 15, 17]. Consistent with this, in addition to Cajal bands disruption, loss of either PRX or of DRP2 is associated with myelin abnormalities that share similarities with those observed in the DG mutant. Other adhesion molecules involved in myelin stability in 
this region is the integrin α6 β4.

Abstract
Myelin is a key evolutionary specialization and adaptation of vertebrates formed by the plasma membrane of glial cells, which insulate axons in the nervous system. Myelination not only allows rapid and efficient transmission of electric impulses in the axon by decreasing capacitance and increasing resistance but also influences axonal metabolism and the plasticity of neural circuits. In this review, we will focus on Schwann cells, the glial cells which form myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we will describe the main extrinsic and intrinsic signals inducing Schwann cell differentiation and myelination and how myelin biogenesis is achieved. Finally, we will also discuss how the study of human disorders in which molecules and pathways relevant for myelination are altered has enormously contributed to the current knowledge on myelin biology.

In line with this idea, stimulation of the rat
sciatic nerve with ATP induces increases in the Ca
2? concentration in both the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix
in myelinating SCs. The ATP-induced cytoplasmic Ca2? increase is mediated by the signaling cascade consisting of
the activation of the P2Y2 purinergic receptor (P2RY2),production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP
3) via
hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by
phospholipase C, and Ca2?release from intracellular Ca2? stores via IP 3receptors. This P2Y2-IP 3-mediated cyto-
plasmic Ca2?mobilization subsequently induces
mitochondrial Ca2?signaling via the MCU. The physiological signiﬁcance of mitochondrial Ca2? signaling in myelinating SCs has been examined in vivo by
disrupting the P2RY2-IP 3-MCU pathway using shRNA for
P2RY2 (shP2RY2), or IP 3-5 phosphatase (5ppase), an
enzyme that suppress IP 3receptor-mediated Ca2?release
by rapidly hydrolyzing IP 3[56–62], or shRNA for MCU
(shMCU). Expression of shP2RY2, 5ppase, or shMCU in
myelinating SCs results in increased levels of phosphory-
lated AMPK, suggesting a critical role for P2RY2-IP 3-
MCU signaling in energy metabolism in myelinating SCs.

of downstream targets, such as eIF4E and 4E-BP1 ( Alain et al.,
2012 ;Cope et al., 2014 ;Jastrzebski et al., 2018 ), may repre-
sent alternative strategies for cancers to acquire resistanceto PI3K and mTOR inhibition. However, most of these find-ings have been identified in in vitro models and/or by the use ofpreclinical mTOR inhibitors (mTORi); thus the in vivo and clinicalrelevance of these findings for breast cancer has remained elusive. Oncogenomic studies have demonstrated frequent activation
of PI3K –AKT –mTOR signaling in the invasive lobular carcinoma
(ILC) histological subtype of breast cancers, suggesting this
pathway to be a particularly promising therapeutic target forILC ( Ciriello et al., 2015 ;Curtis et al., 2012 ;Michaut et al., 2016 ). Conceivably, we previously observed strong activation of anddependence on PI3K –AKT –mTOR signaling in the transplantable
K14-Cre ;Cdh1
F/F;Trp53F/F(KEP) mouse model of ILC ( Klarenbeek
et al., 2020 ;Doornebal et al., 2013 ), thus representing an optimal
in vivo model system to study mechanisms of resistance during
mTOR blockade.

A consistent slow NCV of < 38 m/s in the
arms represents the demyelinating form of CMT1, whereas a value >38 m/s is distinctive
of the axonal form of CMT2. Transitional NCVs (25–45 m/s) are often observed in males
with CMTX1 and in patients with other transitional patterns of CMT [4]. The genetic diagnosis of CMT has been conducted by implementing the targeted next-
generation sequencing and whole-exome sequencing approaches. Over 120 gene mutations
are related to the pathogenesis of CMT and associated neuropathies [ 5,6]. The frequency of
the various types of CMT varies by region and the age at which they were published. In
the study by Saporta et al., 787 out of 1024 patients were diagnosed with CMT; a genetic
subtype was identiﬁed in 527 (67%) of these patients, while the remaining 260 patients did
not present with any identiﬁable mutation. Among the genetically deﬁned cases, CMT1A
(PMP22 ) emerged as the most prevalent subtype, comprising 55% of the cases, followed
by CMTX1 ( GJB1 ; 15.2%), hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP;

In addition, neural 
crest derived satellite glia maintain a tight communication with the 
soma of sensory, sympathetic, and parasympathetic neurons and neural 
crest derivatives are furthermore an indispensable part of the enteric 
nervous system. The remarkable plasticity of SCs becomes evident in the 
context of a nerve injury, where SC transdifferentiate into intriguing 
repair cells, which orchestrate a regenerative response that promotes 
nerve repair. Indeed, the multiple adaptations of SCs are captivating, but 
remain often ill-resolved on the molecular level. Here, we summarize 
and discuss the knowns and unknowns of the vast array of functions that 
this single cell type can cover in peripheral nervous system develop -
ment, maintenance, and repair. Abbreviations: c-JUN, c-JUN transcription factor; C3, complement component 3; CCL2, CC motif chemokine ligand 2; CNS, central nervous system; CR3, com-

It is also reasonable that modulating Nrg1-III 
activity may constitute a general therapeutic strategy to treat 
CMT that are characterized by de/dysmyelination. Recently 
genetic overexpression of Nrg1-III has been shown to ameliorate 
the neurophysiological and morphological parameters in 
a mouse model of CMT1B and stimulating Nrg1-III signaling by 
pharmacological suppression of the Nrg1-III inhibitor TACE also 
ameliorated the neuropathy [46]. The importance of the neur -
egulin pathway is confirmed by the notable finding that soluble 
Neuregulin1 type I promoted myelin repair after nerve injury 
and its administration to CMT1A rats improved their motor 
performance, increased the number of myelinated axons in 
sciatic nerves, and restored the reduced axonal caliber [47]. 2.8. CMT4B: other approaches
CMT4B1 and CMT4B2 are caused by loss-of-function mutations 
in the myotubularin-related 2 (MTMR2, CMT4B1) and MTMR13 
(also known as SBF2, SET binding factor 2, CMT4B2) genes, 
involved in the phosphoinositides (PIs) metabolism [48].

These studies illustrate plasticity and 
adaptation of neuropathic nerves to dietary modulation. Rapamycin, 
a small molecule activator of autophagy, was also tested in TrJ mice, 
and while this orally bioavailable drug improved nerve myelination, it 
failed to benefit neuromuscular performance likely due to the negative 
effect of rapamycin on protein synthesis within skeletal muscle (Nicks 
et al., 2014). TrJ mice have also been employed in gene therapy stud-
ies aiming to silence the mutant L16P- PMP22 allele by specific siRNAs, 
which enhanced motor function and improved nerve conduction veloc-
ity (Lee et al., 2017). Together, these studies indicate that TrJ mice serve 
as a suitable model for therapy testing; however, findings from these 
preclinical animal studies are yet to be translated to clinical applications. A comprehensive examination of the global protein changes within tar-
get nerve tissue is suited to benefit such efforts. While the above cited studies have provided essential insights 
into the pathobiology caused by L16P- PMP22 mutation, a compre -
hensive, global proteomic view of affected nerves has not been de-
scribed.

This time course is based on the currently described data as well as 
the previously published work described in the Discussion. myelinating Schwann cells (Mahley, 1988). More recently, sev- 
eral apolipoproteins, including some produced locally within 
the nerve (apoE, apoD) and others derived from the plasma 
(apoA-I, apoA-IV), have been postulated to play a role in the 
intraneural salvage and reutilization of cholesterol (Boyles et 
al., 1989, 1990; Spreyer et al., 1990). The present data are relevant to several aspects ofthis process 
of cholesterol salvage and reutilization. First, based on the bio- 
chemical literature discussed above and the early labeling of Schwann-cell lipid droplets demonstrated here, it is apparent 
that Schwann cells begin to catabolize their own myelin lipids 
within a day following nerve crush. The early appearance of 
labeled myelin lipids in Schwann-cell lipid droplets clearly rep- 
resents, in part, the recycling of free fatty acids by esterification 
of glycerol, as described above.

Also unclear is why PMP22 would promote cholesterol
transport out of SCs. Perhaps this is a housekeeping role helping to clear excess cholesterol out of healthy SCs. An additional interesting possibility is related to the ability of SCs to actively de-myelinate axons after a nerveinjury, prior to regeneration of healthy myelin. De-myelination may require the clearance of large amounts of
cholesterol and other lipids from damaged myelinated SCs. Perhaps PMP22 and ABCA1 play a critical role in
this process, but only additional data will tell. Conclusions
The studies reviewed here suggest that PMP22 is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, cholesterol traf ﬁcking to
the SC surface (and thence to myelin), lipid raft formation, and cholesterol export. However, the detailedmechanisms and intermolecular interactions involved remain poorly understood. Moreover, the exact teleology
of the seemingly SC-speci ﬁc role of PMP22 in these systems remains to be deciphered. It is clear that too much
or too little PMP22, as well as mutations in PMP22 result in defective cholesterol homeostasis, which likelycontributes to the relevant phenotypes of CMTD (CMT1A, HNPP, DSS, and CMT1E).

Furthermore, neural crest derived cells give rise to satellite glia cells 
around sensory and autonomic neurons. In addition, enteric glial cells 
originate from neural crest cells and are important constituents of the 
enteric nervous system. Often, the function of these glial cell types is less 
well understood compared to their counterparts within the long pe-
ripheral nerves. Here, we provide an overview of the known roles of 
terminal SCs at the NMJ and in the skin and discuss the function of 
satellite and enteric glial cells. For the role of SCs in the CNS, as well as 
for olfactory ensheathing cells, we refer the reader to respective reviews 
on this topic (Chen et al., 2021 ; Reed et al., 2021 ; Stierli et al., 2019 ; 
Ursavas et al., 2021 ). M. Bosch-Queralt et al. Neurobiology of Disease 176 (2023) 105952

Next, we asked whether the disease biomarkers identified in 
the C22 transcriptomic study can be confirmed in the CMT1A rat 
model. Consistent with findings in C22 mice, the mRNA levels of lipid biosynthetic genes such as Sc5d and Ugt8a were decreased in CMT1A rats, although to a lesser extent than in C22 mouse nerves. ASO6 treatment trended toward increased mRNA levels of these genes (Figure 3G). Furthermore, the mRNA levels of Id2  
and Bzw2  were significantly increased in CMT1A rats compared 
with WT rats and were substantially decreased following ASO6 treatment (Figure 3G). Finally, we sought to identify a target engagement biomarker 
in the CMT1A rats. Toward this end, we collected blood and foot -
pad skin biopsies from treated CMT1A rats. Although there was detectable rat Pmp22 mRNA in the blood, there was no change in Pmp22 levels following ASO6 treatment (Supplemental Fig -
ure 5E). The level of rat Pmp22 mRNA in the footpad (containing dermal nerves and Schwann cells) was significantly reduced in ASO6- compared with control-treated rats, suggesting this could serve as a biomarker of target engagement (Figure 3H).

1a and Supplementary Table 4). APOE4-dysregulated processes included upregulation of inflam -
matory and immune-related pathways in several cell types, includ -
ing NF-к B signalling in excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons and 
OPCs; T cell receptor and cytokine signalling in astrocytes; and 
tumour-necrosis-factor-mediated signalling in microglia and excitatory 
neurons (Fig. 1a). We also observed downregulation of synaptic-related 
processes, including ion channel activity, excitatory postsynaptic poten -
tial and synaptic plasticity (Fig. 1a). Notably, these alterations not only 
occurred in neurons (for example, voltage-gated calcium channel activ -
ity), but also in oligodendrocytes (for example, long-term neuronal 
synaptic plasticity). In APOE4 excitatory neurons, we identified upregu -
lation of ERK1/2 signalling (such as MAPK1 , MAP2K1  and MAP2K2 ) and 
endosomal-related transport (such as RAB21  and SNX12) genes (Sup -
plementary Table 4). All of these effects are consistent with the reported 
roles of APOE4 in inflammation, synaptic impairment, MAPK1 signalling 
and downstream APP transcription and early endosomes7,18.

Perinatally, in rodents, SCs radially sort and subsequently myelinate 
individual axons larger than 1 μm in diameter, while small calibre axons become organised in non-myelinating 
Remak bundles. SCs have a vital role in maintaining axonal health throughout life and several specialized SC 
types perform essential functions at specific locations, such as terminal SC at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) 
or SC within cutaneous sensory end organs. In addition, neural crest derived satellite glia maintain a tight 
communication with the soma of sensory, sympathetic, and parasympathetic neurons and neural crest de-
rivatives are furthermore an indispensable part of the enteric nervous system. The remarkable plasticity of SCs 
becomes evident in the context of a nerve injury, where SC transdifferentiate into intriguing repair cells, which 
orchestrate a regenerative response that promotes nerve repair. Indeed, the multiple adaptations of SCs are 
captivating, but remain often ill-resolved on the molecular level.

there were small bspeckles Qof NDRG1 immunoreactivity in

of NDRG1, like that of other myelin-related proteins, decreases
after permanent axotomy and that macrophages contribute to thephagocytosis of myelin-related proteins ( Scherer and Salzer, 2001 ).

Differentiated astrocytes were 
exposed to hypoxia (0.2 % oxygen) for 48 h which was confirmed by 
increased expression of HIF1 α on Western blot (Fig. 1a). After appro -
priate quality control, total cellular RNA was sequenced (n 3 samples each for normoxia and hypoxia). 1365 genes were found to be differ -
entially expressed (log2fold changeF1 and adjusted p-valueD0.1) out of 
which 585 were upregulated while 780 were downregulated in astro-
cytes exposed to hypoxia as compared to normoxic controls (Fig. 1b, 
Supplementary Table S1 and S2). Gene set enrichment analysis to look 
for key gene ontology terms affected in hypoxic injury to astrocytes 
(Supplementary Table S3 and S4) revealed that terms relating to sterol 
and cholesterol biosynthetic pathways (normalised enrichment score 
(NES) 2.35, adjusted p-value 0.004) were positively enriched in hypoxic 
astrocytes (Fig. 1c). Pathway analysis (Supplementary table S5 and S6) 
showed the positive enrichment of HIF 1 signaling pathway (NES 2.06, 
adjusted p-value 0.0034) validating the hypoxia exposure in our in vitro 
model.

Somewhat surprisingly, of the 2,080 DEGs that are induced in the C22 model, only 43 were found to be induced in 
expression analyses of different time points after nerve injury (41, 
44, 45), including the Pou3f1 transcription factor expressed in pro -
myelinating Schwann cells as well as other transcription factors, 
such as Sox4 and Id2  (Supplemental Figure 2, E and F). Indeed, 
none of the previously described c-Jun  target genes (41) were 
induced in the C22 model, indicating that other transcriptional 
programs were enacted by PMP22 overexpression in this model. Relatively few cytokines/chemokines were induced in the C22 model, with the exception of Cxcl14  (46), and immune cell mark -
ers were not an enriched gene ontology category with this data set 
(Supplemental Figure 2G). We next determined whether ASO-mediated suppression 
could restore gene-expression levels toward WT levels and 
found 97 DEGs that behaved in this manner. Among this set, 76 overlapped with the 746 DEGs that significantly changed in the comparison of C22 and WT cohorts at 5 or 15 weeks (Sup -

Several of the deregulat -
ed genes (c-Jun , Pou3f1, Id2, Ednrb ) have been shown to inhibit 
myelination and/or myelin gene expression (41, 50–52). The pro -
filing of ASO-treated animals provided further insight into those gene expression changes, such as those observed for Id2  and 
Bzw2 , that are restored upon ASO treatment. Since this group is 
relatively small (<100), this provides important information on treatment-responsive gene expression changes that help normal-
ize Schwann cell function. Future measurement of these genes 
along with PMP22 mRNA in skin biopsies (as done in the foot pad analysis) could provide important biomarkers that can be used in clinical trials. Since overreduction of PMP22 levels could theoreti-cally cause the HNPP neuropathy caused by loss of a PMP22 allele, evaluation of PMP22 mRNA and other biomarkers can be used to monitor for this clinically. Overall, these studies demonstrate the potential therapeutic utility of ASOs in treating CMT1A and eluci-date the gene expression networks that respond to successful res-
toration of normalized PMP22 levels.

We used a combination of CMT1A mouse models and patient-derived iPSC-SCPs to investigate how pathological alterations 
in lipid metabolism cause CMT1A. We identified cholesterol biosyn
-
thesis and lipid metabolism as the main canonical pathway downre -
gulated in the sciatic nerves of both the C3 and C22 mouse models, 
similar to what was reported in CMT1A rats.49The PMP22 copy num -
ber had a dose-dependent effect on cholesterol biosynthesis, which we found by comparing the C3 and C22 mouse models, which express five and seven copies of the human PMP22 gene, respectively. High 
cholesterol levels are essential for myelin membrane growth. 50
Likewise, PMP22 overexpression reduced the expression of genes

Mutations in MPZ 
can prevent the mutant protein from reaching the membrane 
and cause its retention and accumulation in the ER inducing 
apoptosis and subsequent neuropathy. Retention of the 
mutant proteins in the ER leads to activation of the UPR, an 
adaptive and protective process to relieve stress from mis-
folded proteins (Figure 2). However, when cells are in chronic 
stress, such as in CMT1B, the UPR becomes inadequate, and it 
activates apoptotic pathways resulting in cell death or abnor -
mal signaling. Many MPZ mutations were shown to activate 
the UPR and cause CMT1B, and these mutations may be 
susceptible to future therapies targeting the UPR [32]. The 
first studies showed a potential benefit from curcumin, 
which is able to modulate the UPR among its many activities 
[33,34]. More recently, Sephin-1 (IFB-088) – an inhibitor of the 
dephosphorylation of eIF2a, a kinase belonging to the PERK 
arm of the UPR – that prolongs protein translation attenuation 
in response to stress, was shown to be beneficial in the S63del 
and R98C MPZ mouse models, prolonging the response and 
preventing the molecular, morphological and motor defects of 
the neuropathy [35,36].

However, it was
found that ABCA1-dependent cholesterol ef ﬂux was decreased. This was detected as a sharp decrease in ApoE
secretion (along with cholesterol) in PMP22 KO SC cultures. Decreased cholesterol ef ﬂux was explained by
observation that traf ﬁcking of ABCA1 to the plasma membrane was signi ﬁcantly decreased. This was found
when cyclosporin A-blocking endocytosis of plasma membrane-associated ABCA1 resulted in no effect on
levels of secreted cholesterol, suggesting minimal levels of ABCA1 at the plasma membrane of PMP22 KOmouse SCs. Reduced levels of ABCA1 at the plasma membrane were con ﬁrmed by cell surface immuno ﬂuores-
cence microscopy in both nerves and cultured SCs. These results in PMP22 KO mice suggest an important role for PMP22 in promoting ABCA1-mediated chol-
esterol export from SCs, although the mechanism remains uncertain. Interestingly, PMP22 protein levels in
ABCA1 KO mouse nerves were increased 1.5-fold over WT while other myelin genes MAG, MPZ, and p75
remained relatively unchanged.

2 B ). This indicated functional ac-
tivation of MYC in AZD8055-resistant tumors. We next per-formed transcription factor (TF) target enrichment analysisusing the TF target information collected from previouslypublished genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)assays and motif-based prediction, as deposited in the EnrichRresource ( Kuleshov et al., 2016 ). Upregulated genes in resistant
tumors showed the strongest enrichment for genes containing
binding sites for MYC as well as MYC-binding motifs ( Fig. 2, C
and D ). Finally, MS-expression proteomics data similarly re-
vealed the activation of MYC targets in resistant tumors ascompared with control and sensitive tumors ( Fig. 2, E and F ). Taken together, these data show that during long-term AZD8055treatment, MYC governs a transcriptional program potentiallydriving resistance to mTORi. MYC directs biological processes associated with
mTORi responseTo gain insight into the resistance-associated transcriptionalprograms mediated by MYC, we further explored the GSVAresults ( Fig.

The drug was administered to explant cultures of C22 mice, which im-
proved processing of PMP22 and enhanced myelin internodal proﬁle; it also increased the
production of other myelin-related proteins; nevertheless, despite these potential in vitro
outcomes, rapamycin did not recover neuromuscular performance in the Tr-J mouse model
in vivo [50]. 3.2.8. Sox2 and Id2
The myelination status of SCs appears to be detected by the stability between opposing
signaling systems. Positive regulators such as Krox-20, Oct-6, Sox-10, Brn2, and NF- B are
predominant in normal nerves, but the balance shifts to negative regulators such as c-Jun,
Notch, Pax-3, Sox2, and Id2 in the injured and pathological nerves. In addition, negative
regulators may be important in the onset and myelination rate during growth (59). The
continued expression of Sox2 and Id2 seems to perform a protective function in neuropathy
since their elimination in P0S63del mice—a CMT1B mouse model—led to an exacerbation
of the dysmyelinating phenotype [ 51].

Perisynaptic SCs have also been 
shown to promote the functional recovery of injured NMJs via secretion 
of CXCL12 α and an interaction with CXCR4 on axon terminals (Negro 
et al., 2017 ). In line, the ablation of perisynaptic SC in mice impaired the 
remodelling of the neuromuscular junctions after injury, and limited 
reinnervation (Hastings et al., 2020 ). Notably, a recent study demon -
strates that injury induced functional changes of perisynaptic SC, 
assessed as reduced mAChR-mediated Ca2responses by perisynaptic 
SC persist for at least 60 days after injury (Perez-Gonzalez et al., 2022 ). 4.2. Schwann cells of the skin 
Schwann cells of the skin are neural crest derived and also originate 
from boundary-cap cells, the latter giving rise to SC associated with 
dermal nerve fibers, lanceolate sensory endings around hair follicles and free nerve endings (Gresset et al., 2015 ; Radomska and Topilko, 2017 ). Boundary cap derived SCs in the skin retain furthermore a multipotent 
capacity and represent a major stem-cell like population in the dermis 
(Gresset et al., 2015 ; Radomska and Topilko, 2017 ).

Finally, other CMT proteins interact with the F-actin cytoskeleton such as PRX (CMT4F) or regulates its assembly, such as FGD4, a GEF for Cdc42 GTPase, which is mutated in the autosomal recessive CMT4H. In conclusion, the generation and characterization of ani -
mal models for these neuropathies as well as the increasing number of IPN genes identified using NGS (next generation sequencing) technologies has enormously contributed to expand and deep our knowledge on myelin biology. In turn, the knowledge of the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms allowed to design and validate at the preclinical level prom-ising therapeutical approaches, which can be potentially translated to human in a near future [129– 133].

CMT1A exhibits dysregulated lipid biosynthesis
Comparative microarrays were used to compare gene expression from sciatic nerves of WT rats with mildly and
severely affected CMT1A model rats expressing a 3rd WT PMP22 allele [ 24]. It was found that dysregulation of
22 lipid metabolism genes correlated with disease severity. In both mildly and severely affected animals mostexamined lipid metabolism genes were down-regulated at both 1 week and 9 weeks of age. Interestingly, there
was an age-dependent switch between mildly affected and severely affected rats with mildly affected rats exhibit-
ing more lipid biosynthetic gene dysregulation at 1 week of age and severely affected rats exhibiting more lipidbiosynthesis gene dysregulation at 9 weeks of age. Follow-up quantitative PCR experiments validated Adipoq,
Lpl, Scd1, Pparg, Prkar2b, Ssg1, and Thrsp as being dysregulated. Figure 1. Cartoon representation for the AlphaFold2-predicted structure of PMP22. Highlighted are locations of the CRAC motif in TM4 (residues 147 –159, red), CARC motif in TM3 (residues 92 –104, blue), and
