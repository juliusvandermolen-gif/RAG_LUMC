Feedback Loops and MicroRNA Regulatio n: 
• MYC expression is tightly regulated by feedback loops and microRNAs. PMP22 may alter 
the expression of specific microRNAs that target MYC, such as  let-7 or miR-34a, 
thereby affecting MYC levels . Experimental Validatio n 
 
To establish a causal relationship, you could:  
• Use Western blottin g or qPC R to measure MYC expression after PMP22 overexpression . • Apply  pharmacological inhibitor s or genetic tools (e.g., CRISPR) to block suspected 
signaling pat hways and observe changes in MYC expression . • Assess the role of ER stress markers (e.g., CHOP, BiP) to link PMP22 overexpression to 
UPR . By understanding these mechanisms, you might 
uncover novel insights into cellular stress, growth, and 
oncogenic tran sformation driven by PMP22 
overexpression.

However, while high-fat diet can partially compensate for a deﬁciency in fatty
acid synthesis in the CNS, in the PNS a high fat diet results in worsening of myelin defects when fatty
acid synthesis is impaired [ 110,111]. The mechanisms underlying di erential e ects in the CNS vs.
PNS remain to be determined. Taken together the current literature suggests that the uptake of fatty
acid may not be the primary pathway for myelin formation. However, the importance of fatty acid
uptake contributing to the energetic metabolism of myelinating cells and axonal trophic support is
still unclear. Finally, there is also new evidence that lipids could be provided to myelin cells by neurons. A recent study found that fatty acids are released by hyperactive neurons and can be taken up by
neighboring glia to protect neurons from fatty acid toxicity [158]. 11. Fatty Acid Oxidation
The nervous system has very high metabolic demands. Notably the CNS consumes 20% of
the body’s oxygen supply. While the metabolic requirements for neural activity have been well
characterized, the energetic requirement for myelin formation and maintenance, as well as the
mechanisms for energetic production in myelinating cells, are not well understood [ 159].

We identify a number of strategies to reduce pTau in a
CE-dependent manner and ﬁnd that allosteric activation ofCYP46A1 is a neuron-speciﬁc CE-lowering strategy particularly

a CYP46A1-CE-Tau axis as an early druggable pathway in AD. RESULTS
A Drug Screen in iPSC-Derived Human FAD Neurons to
Identify Compounds that Reduce pTau Accumulation
pThr231Tau is an early marker of AD pathology that correlateswell with cognitive decline ( Buerger et al., 2002; Luna-Mun ˜oz
et al., 2007 ). pThr231Tau accumulates in APP duplication
(APP
dp) iPSC-derived FAD neurons ( Israel et al., 2012 ). To iden-tify compounds that reduce pTau accumulation in these FAD
neurons, we screened a collection of 1,684 approved and
preclinical drugs for their efﬁcacy to lower neuronal pThr231Tau. For our screen, neural progenitor cells (NPCs; line APPdp1-6)
(Israel et al., 2012 ) were differentiated to neurons ( Figures S1 A
and S1B) for 3 weeks, replated in 384 well plates, and allowed
to mature for 2 weeks before treatment with compound at5mM for 5 days.

sent alternative strategies for cancers to acquire resistanceto PI3K and mTOR inhibition. However, most of these find-ings have been identified in in vitro models and/or by the use ofpreclinical mTOR inhibitors (mTORi); thus the in vivo and clinicalrelevance of these findings for breast cancer has remained elusive. Oncogenomic studies have demonstrated frequent activation
of PI3K –AKT –mTOR signaling in the invasive lobular carcinoma
(ILC) histological subtype of breast cancers, suggesting this
pathway to be a particularly promising therapeutic target forILC ( Ciriello et al., 2015 ;Curtis et al., 2012 ;Michaut et al., 2016 ). Conceivably, we previously observed strong activation of anddependence on PI3K –AKT –mTOR signaling in the transplantable
K14-Cre ;Cdh1
F/F;Trp53F/F(KEP) mouse model of ILC ( Klarenbeek

It is also reasonable that modulating Nrg1-III 
activity may constitute a general therapeutic strategy to treat 
CMT that are characterized by de/dysmyelination. Recently 
genetic overexpression of Nrg1-III has been shown to ameliorate 
the neurophysiological and morphological parameters in 
a mouse model of CMT1B and stimulating Nrg1-III signaling by 
pharmacological suppression of the Nrg1-III inhibitor TACE also 
ameliorated the neuropathy [46]. The importance of the neur -
egulin pathway is confirmed by the notable finding that soluble 
Neuregulin1 type I promoted myelin repair after nerve injury 
and its administration to CMT1A rats improved their motor 
performance, increased the number of myelinated axons in 
sciatic nerves, and restored the reduced axonal caliber [47]. 2.8. CMT4B: other approaches
CMT4B1 and CMT4B2 are caused by loss-of-function mutations 
in the myotubularin-related 2 (MTMR2, CMT4B1) and MTMR13 
(also known as SBF2, SET binding factor 2, CMT4B2) genes, 
involved in the phosphoinositides (PIs) metabolism [48].

To obtain better insights into the under -
lying pathogenic mechanisms in CMT1A, we investigated the role of PMP22 duplication in cellular homeostasis in 
CMT1A mouse models and in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated into Schwann cell precur -
sors (iPSC-SCPs). We performed lipidomic profiling and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on sciatic nerves of two developing CMT1A 
mouse models and on CMT1A patient-derived iPSC-SCPs. For the sciatic nerves of the CMT1A mice, cholesterol 
and lipid metabolism was downregulated in a dose-dependent manner throughout development. For the CMT1A 
iPSC-SCPs, transcriptional analysis unveiled a strong suppression of genes related to autophagy and lipid metabol -
ism. Gene ontology enrichment analysis identified disturbances in pathways related to plasma membrane compo -
nents and cell receptor signalling. Lipidomic analysis confirmed the severe dysregulation in plasma membrane 
lipids, particularly sphingolipids, in CMT1A iPSC-SCPs. Furthermore, we identified reduced lipid raft dynamics, dis -
turbed plasma membrane fluidity and impaired cholesterol incorporation and storage, all of which could result from 
altered lipid storage homeostasis in the patient-derived CMT1A iPSC-SCPs.

ing NF-к B signalling in excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons and 
OPCs; T cell receptor and cytokine signalling in astrocytes; and 
tumour-necrosis-factor-mediated signalling in microglia and excitatory 
neurons (Fig. 1a). We also observed downregulation of synaptic-related 
processes, including ion channel activity, excitatory postsynaptic poten -
tial and synaptic plasticity (Fig. 1a). Notably, these alterations not only 
occurred in neurons (for example, voltage-gated calcium channel activ -
ity), but also in oligodendrocytes (for example, long-term neuronal 
synaptic plasticity). In APOE4 excitatory neurons, we identified upregu -
lation of ERK1/2 signalling (such as MAPK1 , MAP2K1  and MAP2K2 ) and 
endosomal-related transport (such as RAB21  and SNX12) genes (Sup -

roles of APOE4 in inflammation, synaptic impairment, MAPK1 signalling 
and downstream APP transcription and early endosomes7,18.

secretase activity but rather acts as receptor for Lgi4 (leucine-rich repeat LGI family member 4) secreted by Schwann cells (Fig. 2) [69]. Analysis of the spontaneous 
mutant claw paw (clp) carrying a recessive mutation in Lgi4 revealed a key role for this molecule in promoting myelina-tion during development [70]. Nerves from the claw paw mutant are severely hypomyelinated and present defects in radial sorting. Consistent with this, nerves from conditional mutants lacking ADAM22 are also hypomyelinated [69]. The precise mechanisms of action of Lgi4 and ADAM22 in the PNS, which are not restricted to the axo-glia juxtacrine interaction, remain to be clarified. Notch-1 .

In contrast, in the PNS, plasmalogens are important for
two fundamental events of Schwann cell development: axon-glia recognition and myelination. Plasmalogen-deﬁcient Schwann cells present an impairment of AKT activation at the plasma

6. Phosphatidylcholine
Phosphatidylcholines (also called lecithin) are an abundant phospholipid found in myelin,
particularly in the PNS (Table 1). Phosphatidylcholines are composed by (1) a choline head group,
(2) a glycerophosphoric acid backbone, and (3) fatty acids tails (Figure 1). They are structural
components of the myelin, with functions in initiation, compaction and maintenance of plasma
membrane [ 80]. In oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, the predominant pathway to synthesize
phosphatidylcholines relies on de novo synthesis through choline uptake [ 81]. Phosphatidylcholines
preferentially integrate in the outer layer of the myelin sheath; however, previous studies in Schwann
cells have shown that phospholipids that are integrated ﬁrst in outer layers of the myelin may move
within the membrane to the inner layer [ 82,83].

Approximately 30 diseases are related to the differentially expressed 
protein groups of the neuropathic nerves. These diseases range be-
tween the groupings of endocrine and nutritional, congenital and 
chromosomal abnormalities, and nervous system diseases (Figure  8a). We chose to focus on nervous system disorders due to their rele-
vance to the current study. Neurological diseases identified include 
illnesses of the myoneural junction and muscle, systemic atrophies of 
the CNS, episodic and paroxysmal disorders, and polyneuropathies of the PNS (Figure  8b). Figure  8c depicts the top six neural disorders 
(A- F), which share overlapping protein perturbations with the neuro-
pathic nerves, and the specific proteins corresponding to the disease 
are represented in the chord diagram. As expected, CMT is the most 
enriched nervous system disease, while there are parallels with other 
illnesses as well. For example, TrJ mouse nerves display abnormal ac-
cumulation of cellular products in the cytoplasm (Fortun et al., 2003; 
Zhou et al., 2020), similar to neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, which 
represents a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by 
undegraded lysosomal cargo (Nita et al., 2016).

Astro -
cytes are also known to influence oligodendrocyte development by 
modulating the availability of growth factors and nutrients required for 
oligodendrocyte differentiation [4]. Astrocyte activation in response to 
CNS injury can have both protective and detrimental effects on overall 
neuronal survival and myelination [5]. In this study, we aimed to study 
the effect of hypoxia on astrocytes to delineate the pathways that could 
potentially impact oligodendrocyte maturation. Transcriptomic analysis of human fetal neural stem cell-derived as-
trocytes subjected to hypoxia demonstrated the upregulation of 
cholesterol biosynthetic pathways. These findings were validated by 
measuring the gene and protein expression of cholesterol synthetic and 
transport proteins in FNSC-derived astrocytes and in a cell line model. Astrocyte cholesterol content and efflux was also increased in response

Thus, by analogy with epithelial cell polar -
ity, the abaxonal membrane of myelinated fibers is defined as a basolateral-like region, whereas the adaxonal membrane, SLI, paranodes and microvilli are considered apical-like regions [18, 19]. Schwann Cell Development
During early vertebrate development, neural crest cells delaminate from the neural tube, proliferate, and migrate to generate a broad spectrum of cell types including, among others, Schwann cells, melanocytes, sympathetic neurons, sensory neurons, and skeletal and connective tissues of the head [24– 26]. The cell fate largely depends from the region 
of origin of the neural tube from which neural crest cells migrate. These regions are defined in an anterior–posterior axis direction as cranial, cardiac, vagal, trunk, and sacral. In particular, Schwann cells, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons, sympathetic neurons, and satellite cells associated with sensory neurons, all originate from ventrally migrating trunk neural crest cells [27].

 PrPC is another axonal 
membrane-tethered protein that has been shown to have a role in myelin maintenance [68]. Loss of 
 PrPC specifically 
in neurons leads to normal myelin development but to a late onset peripheral neuropathy with myelin degeneration [68].

peripheral nerves are intrinsically more difficult to study as 
compared to the muscles and even to the motor neurons: it is 
problematic to obtain nerve tissue to be studied and charac -
terized, Schwann cells and myelination studies are particularly 
challenging, and it is currently extremely hard if not impossi -
ble to obtain reliable Schwann cells from iPSCs. It is also 
arduous to target drugs and gene therapies to the peripheral 
nerves, particularly to correct Schwann cell defects. Other 
reasons are constituted by: the great genetic heterogeneity

involved in CMT and related neuropathies; the great variability

Perinatally, in rodents, SCs radially sort and subsequently myelinate 
individual axons larger than 1 μm in diameter, while small calibre axons become organised in non-myelinating 
Remak bundles. SCs have a vital role in maintaining axonal health throughout life and several specialized SC 
types perform essential functions at specific locations, such as terminal SC at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) 
or SC within cutaneous sensory end organs. In addition, neural crest derived satellite glia maintain a tight 
communication with the soma of sensory, sympathetic, and parasympathetic neurons and neural crest de-
rivatives are furthermore an indispensable part of the enteric nervous system. The remarkable plasticity of SCs 
becomes evident in the context of a nerve injury, where SC transdifferentiate into intriguing repair cells, which

At this stage, at E (embryonic stage)12–13 in the mouse and E14–15 in the rat, SCPs and developing axons are not surrounded by connective tissue and do not have blood structures to supply them [24– 26]. Surprisingly, SCPs do not influence axons to 
growth and to reach the target [28, 29]. In mouse mutants 
lacking SCPs, axons grow normally but are defasciculated at the nerve terminal with altered branching and sprouting [29]. On the contrary, at later stages, DRG sensory neu-
rons and motor neurons die, suggesting that glial cells are crucial to provide trophic support to axons [25]. Similarly to neural crest cells, SCPs maintain an extraordinary multi-potency and plasticity as they can generate melanocytes, sensory neurons, parasympathetic neurons, and fibroblasts, which will constitute the “mature” endoneurium [25, 30].

Schwann cells express Sox10 at all stages of development 
as early as in migratory neural crest cells before lineage specification, thus suggesting that Sox10 is a key determi-nant of Schwann cell identity [41, 42]. Sox10 is also crucial 
in terminal differentiation and in myelin maintenance, as it controls the expression of several myelin genes encoding P0, MBP, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and Cx32 [33]. Conditional deletion in adult nerves showed that Sox10 
is also required for myelin homeostasis to maintain myelin integrity [43]. In mutant mice lacking Oct6, myelin genes are repressed 
and myelination is blocked [44, 45]. A double Oct6/Brn2  
KO model shows a more severe phenotype as compared to single Oct6 KO, thus suggesting that these factors cooperate 
to promote the transition to a myelinating phenotype. Even if more severe than the single KO, in Oct6/Brn2, double KO myelination is delayed but not completely blocked [46]. This finding led to the hypothesis that another factor such as Brn1 can in part compensate loss of Oct6 in vivo [47].

In both cases, a single, continuous basal lamina covers 
these neuron-satellite glia units, which are separated from each other by 
connective tissue (Pannese, 2010 ). During development, SGCs are 
derived from neural crest cells and likely furthermore originate from 
boundary cap cells (Jessen and Mirsky, 2005 ; Marol et al., 2004 ). As 
SGCs share several similarities with SC precursor cells, they have been 
suggested to represent a population of developmentally arrested SCs 
(George et al., 2018 ). Though, other studies demonstrate a molecular 
profile more reminiscent to astrocytes (Avraham et al., 2020 ; Jager 
et al., 2020 ; van Weperen et al., 2021 ) and emphasize overlapping 
functions to astrocytes in the CNS (Hanani and Spray, 2020 ; Huang 
et al., 2013 ). However, satellite glial cells were shown to also express 
unique genes that are absent in SCs and astrocytes (Mapps et al., 2022 ). Recent RNA-sequencing studies identified a pronounced M. Bosch-Queralt et al. Neurobiology of Disease 176 (2023) 105952

their association with either sensory or sympathetic ganglia (Avraham 
et al., 2021 ; Mapps et al., 2022 ; Tasdemir-Yilmaz et al., 2021 ; van 
Weperen et al., 2021 ).

As exoge -
nous cholesterol enhanced oligodendrocyte differentiation, our findings indicate that increased cholesterol 
synthesis by astrocytes and transport to oligodendrocytes could supplement oligodendroglial maturation in 
conditions of hypoxic brain injury in neonates. 1.Introduction
Hypoxic injury to the developing fetal brain can result in widespread 
neuronal loss and demyelination leading to long-term cognitive and 
neuromotor deficits. Oligodendrocytes, the myelin producing cells in the 
central nervous system differentiate from fetal neural stem cells (FNSCs) 
through the intermediate stages of proliferative oligodendrocyte pre-
cursor cells (OPCs) and post-mitotic migratory premyelinating oligo -
dendrocytes [1]. Loss of myelination seen in hypoxic-ischemic brain 
injury occurs secondary to injury to vulnerable premyelinating oligo -
dendrocyte population in the preterm fetal brain [2]. Astrocytes are glial cells that have numerous important roles in 
maintaining homeostasis in the central nervous system such as the 
provision of metabolic support, buffering of ions, recycling neurotransmitters and formation of the blood brain barrier [3].

only seen in cells differentiated using PMA with cholesterol (p 0.001). 4.Discussion
Hypoxic injury to the preterm brain leads to death of vulnerable 
premyelinating oligodendrocytes which are the most abundant oligo -
dendroglial lineage cells in the brain at 27–32 weeks of gestation [10]. Hypoxic injury to premyelinating oligodendrocytes leads to failure of 
maturation and myelination [11]. Astrocytes influence oligodendroglial 
development through the secretion of growth factors and providing 
metabolic support in both physiological and pathological states [12]. In 
this study, the mechanisms by which altered astrocyte function in 
hypoxic conditions could impact oligodendrocyte development were 
investigated. A model of primary human astrocytes differentiated from 
fetal neural stem cells and characterised for the expression of astrocyte- 
specific proteins [6] was used.

Next, we asked whether the disease biomarkers identified in 
the C22 transcriptomic study can be confirmed in the CMT1A rat 
model. Consistent with findings in C22 mice, the mRNA levels of lipid biosynthetic genes such as Sc5d and Ugt8a were decreased in CMT1A rats, although to a lesser extent than in C22 mouse nerves. ASO6 treatment trended toward increased mRNA levels of these genes (Figure 3G). Furthermore, the mRNA levels of Id2  
and Bzw2  were significantly increased in CMT1A rats compared 
with WT rats and were substantially decreased following ASO6 treatment (Figure 3G). Finally, we sought to identify a target engagement biomarker 
in the CMT1A rats. Toward this end, we collected blood and foot -
pad skin biopsies from treated CMT1A rats. Although there was detectable rat Pmp22 mRNA in the blood, there was no change in Pmp22 levels following ASO6 treatment (Supplemental Fig -
ure 5E). The level of rat Pmp22 mRNA in the footpad (containing dermal nerves and Schwann cells) was significantly reduced in ASO6- compared with control-treated rats, suggesting this could serve as a biomarker of target engagement (Figure 3H).

parison to its CMT1A mutant counterpart ( Supplementary Fig. 6).During differentiation, the iPSC colonies acquired a Schwann cell- 
like morphology, accompanied by the expression of key proteins 
marking the transitions from iPSCs to early neural crest cells, SCPs and, ultimately, Schwann cells (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Figs 2

genes essential to Schwann cell lineage development (Fig. 3C). We 
also observed that these iPSC-SCs were capable of producing myelin when co-cultured with mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons (Fig. 3D). Bulk RNA-seq indicated that the transcriptome of CMT1A and 
isogenic iPSC-SCPs was similar to that of neural crest progenitors

Identification of 
a well- established marker of axonal disease, G3BP1, substantiates 
the notion that irrespective of the cellular origin of the neuropathy, 
the dynamic interplay between the axon and myelinated glia is per-
turbed early- on in affected nerves. This unbiased global proteomic study confirms our previous 
work on the involvement of degradative pathways in PMP22-  
linked neuropathies (Fortun et al., 2003; Notterpek et al., 1997). Since PMP22, the disease- causing protein, is prone to aggregation 
when mutated or overexpressed (Notterpek, Ryan, et al., 1999), 
the mistrafficked protein induces a proteostatic dysbalance (Fortun 
et al., 2003). Dysregulated proteins identified in this study include 
autophagy- related cathepsins B, C, D, and Z, lysosomal- associated 
membrane protein 2, and several other molecules that comprise the 
lysosome and proteasome pathways (Figures 5 and 6 ). Recent ev-
idence suggests that the close regulation of autophagy is directly 
related to the pathobiology of neurodegeneration and is linked 
to the clearance of intracellular waste in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, 
and Huntington's diseases (Song et al., 2021).

Abstract
Myelin is a key evolutionary specialization and adaptation of vertebrates formed by the plasma membrane of glial cells, which insulate axons in the nervous system. Myelination not only allows rapid and efficient transmission of electric impulses in the axon by decreasing capacitance and increasing resistance but also influences axonal metabolism and the plasticity of neural circuits. In this review, we will focus on Schwann cells, the glial cells which form myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we will describe the main extrinsic and intrinsic signals inducing Schwann cell differentiation and myelination and how myelin biogenesis is achieved. Finally, we will also discuss how the study of human disorders in which molecules and pathways relevant for myelination are altered has enormously contributed to the current knowledge on myelin biology.

The
results of this study propose that the pharmacological suppression of the P2X7 receptor is
tolerable in CMT1A rats, thus offering an evidence-based suggestion that inhibiting this
pathway could rectify the molecular abnormalities and enhance the clinical presentation
of CMT1A neuropathy [ 28]. The transition to clinical experiments for CMT1A is made
smoother by prior Phase II clinical trials involving rheumatoid arthritis, where a P2X7
antagonist demonstrated satisfactory safety and tolerability [29]. 3.1.6. Lipid Supplementation
In a rat model of CMT1A, myelinating SCs display a developmental deﬁciency char-
acterized by lessened genes transcription necessary for myelin lipid biosynthesis. The
supplementation of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in the diet of rats
enhanced biosynthesis of myelin and nerve function. While clinical experiments have
shown no disadvantages from this therapy, it is still uncertain if high amounts of dietary
phospholipids can help CMT1A patients [ 21].

nerve repair. Indeed, the multiple adaptations of SCs are captivating, but

Furthermore, neural crest derived cells give rise to satellite glia cells 
around sensory and autonomic neurons. In addition, enteric glial cells 
originate from neural crest cells and are important constituents of the 
enteric nervous system. Often, the function of these glial cell types is less 
well understood compared to their counterparts within the long pe-
ripheral nerves. Here, we provide an overview of the known roles of 
terminal SCs at the NMJ and in the skin and discuss the function of 
satellite and enteric glial cells. For the role of SCs in the CNS, as well as 
for olfactory ensheathing cells, we refer the reader to respective reviews

occurring for the same gene mutation (particularly for the 
CMT1A duplication), sometimes even within the same family; 
the slow disease progression in many CMT cases, which is 
good for the patients but makes it difficult to measure wor -
sening in natural history studies and assess benefit from 
tested treatments; and the rarity of the majority of CMT 
types, a challenge for studies on pathomechanisms and clin-
ical trials. Therefore, there is still a lot of work to do with 
preclinical and clinical studies before effective treatments 
become available for many CMT forms. From the preclinical standpoint, it is important to work on 
reliable animal models reproducing the disease as close as 
possible. There are many novel available models, particularly 
rodents, but flies and zebrafishes are also gaining popularity 
because they allow cheaper and more rapid studies with 
greater animal numbers; the use of patient-specific iPSCs to 
derive neural cells constitutes a major advance to understand 
pathogenic mechanisms of disease and to test potential ther -
apeutic compounds [61].

[25]. mRNA expression of both lipid catabolizing and anabolizing transcripts were affected. This study further
showed that during development, lipid metabolism genes (including those of sterol metabolism) failed to
up-regulate in a CMT1A background compared with WT, suggesting a failure to engage lipid synthesis during
myelination. Lipidomics studies conducted on CMT1A rats and human serum samples [ 26] found that rat sciatic nerves
exhibited impaired sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism in which ceramides, sphingomyelins,
hexosylceramides, and sphingosine were all reduced in CMT1A samples [ 26]. An earlier study also found these
same lipid species to be reduced in CMT1A rat sciatic nerve myelin and also cholesterol, PC, and PG lipid
species [ 25,26]. The two studies tested regimens of lipid supplementation (by either adding lipids or various
components of different lipid biosynthetic pathways) and observed improvements in myelination. A transcriptomic analysis of C3 (CMT1A model) mice found that the most severely down-regulated genes
were those involved in cholesterol biosynthesis [ 27].

In amphibians, GPCR activation 
in perisynaptic SC has a negative impact on synaptic transmitter release, 
whereas GPCR inhibition prevented this synaptic depression (Robitaille, 
1998 ). On the other hand, Ca2chelation in perisynaptic SC has been 
shown to dissolve synaptic potentiation (Castonguay and Robitaille, 
2001 ), demonstrating that “perisynaptic SC” can both decrease and in-
crease synaptic activity. The type of modulation has been shown to be 
influenced by the pattern of synaptic firing resulting in distinct “peri-
synaptic SC” calcium kinetics and an ATP release from perisynaptic SC 
(Todd et al., 2010 ). In addition, perisynaptic SC may also release a 
number of other neuromodulatory molecules, including glutamate, ni-
tric oxide and prostaglandines (Ko and Robitaille, 2015 ). After nerve injury, perisynaptic SC emanate long sprouts that can 
form bridges between neighbouring NMJs (Son and Thompson, 1995 ). Upon reinnervation, axons can pass these bridges and innervate adjacent 
endplates (Kang et al., 2003 ; Love and Thompson, 1999 ; Reynolds and 
Woolf, 1993 ; Son and Thompson, 1995 ).

Mutations in the Myelin Protein Zero (MPZ) cause 
either early-onset demyelinating/hypomyelinating neuropa -
thies (CMT1B) or later-onset mainly axonal neuropathies 
(sometimes labeled as CMT2I/CMT2J). CMTX1 is the second 
most frequent form of CMT after CMT1A, is inherited as an 
X-linked dominant trait and is caused by mutations in GJB1 , 
encoding connexin 32 (Cx32), which forms gap junctions in 
Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes. Most if not all GJB1 
mutations causing CMTX1 behave as loss-of-function muta -
tions as the Cx32 gap-junctions are lacking or defective. Mutations in a protein localized in the mitochondrial mem -
brane, Mitofusin-2, are the most common cause of axonal CMT 
(CMT2A) [2]. Despite the great advances in understanding the genetic 
and biological bases of inherited neuropathies, there is still no 
treatment available for any type of CMT. However, this is 
a rapidly evolving field and several novel approaches are 
providing encouraging results in preclinical studies and are 
leading to clinical trials.
