Maybe too to be true
Check which genes are within these gene pathways
lipid stuff are not present in IPA
Cholesterol metabolism forinstance is not in IPA. Check which genes are supposedly invested in these. --> make sure that the pathway are rightly called

1000 is quite nice, however Xenobiotic Metabolism Signaling is always bullshit!
There is a baked in bias, this is however not a problem as you know what experiment was run. 
IPA/Reactome/Gprofiler has lower amount of bias --> researchers have to filter out the bullshit pathways themself --> gpt removes this by introducing bias.
