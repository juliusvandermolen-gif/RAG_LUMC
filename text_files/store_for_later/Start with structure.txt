Abstract is 10 lines: GSEA difficult, IPA is expensive, using LLM might work, small models are not able do GSEA. RAG might be helpful?( similar to presentation).

Ask GPT to compare output from LLM to compare with gprofiler (blue terms from go) and IPA
Check gene size for GO annotations, everything above 500 genes are too general

(Check whether calculating distance requires CUDA/FP32/FP64)
Add speed testing to the results

Check whether there is a difference between the different users.

Searching for novel pathways? Maybe don't limit
Otherwise, maybe limit
Cholesterol is due to reference data? → with scope cholesterol isn't noticed because it's irrelevant. However, it could be novel, but is it mentioned in the pathway?  → reference add a part to the outcome. Lots of papers focussed on cholesterol
Ask GPT for the list of pathways/genes, show why they are there. Indicate which genes are with the article. (Not including my own reference papers). Don't really recommend: Either curate PDFs, or trust that all of your PDFs are of use. RAG + scope → specific. May found pathways that aren't that interesting but they are relevant and factual.

Use API, to query the pathways/genes combinations, do it per pathway with genes. Use o1-mini + batch requests. Try to include an article to proof that its true. Output This gene has to do with this pathway, with this article as proof (citation/ref if possible). If search is not possible, use 4o


Can we use biolinkbert as replacement for FAISS? for retrieval. FAISS is only to compare distance? or could it be used for more
