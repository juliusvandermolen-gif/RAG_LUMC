●Compounds preventing axonal degeneration or rescuing altered axo-
nal transport have the potentiality to cure many hereditary neuro -
pathies irrespective of the primary triggering defect: this is the case 
for the inhibitors of SARM1 and of HDAC6, an active field of research. ●Intervention on more specific metabolic pathways is also promising, 
such as for L-Serine to treat HSN1 by reducing neurotoxic deoxy -
sphingolipids, or compounds acting on the PYKfive enzyme in the 
phosphoinositides metabolism in CMT4B, or S-adenosylmethionine 
(SAM) to supply purine nucleotides in CMTX5 and its allelic disorders. ●Mutations in sorbitol dehydrogenase has been very recently asso -
ciated with a relatively common form of CMT2/dHMN and high levels 
of sorbitol. Inhibitors of aldose reductase, developed in the past for 
diabetic neuropathy, are good candidates for its treatment. Table 1. List of CMT genes associated with the different types of CMT and related neuropathies. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and related neuropathies

et al. described the frequency, detection rate, and mutation types in 14 representative
genes ( PMP22 ,GJB1 ,MPZ ,MFN2 ,SH3TC2 ,GDAP1 ,NEFL ,LITAF ,GARS ,HSPB1 ,FIG4 ,
EGR2 ,PRX , and RAB7A ) related to CMT in a cohort study of 17,880 patients tested in a
commercial genetic laboratory. Genetic anomalies were detected in 18.5% (n = 3312) of the
total population. Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampliﬁcation
revealed that duplications (56.7%) or deletions (21.9%) in PMP22 were reported for most of
the positive results; next, mutations were detected in GJB1 (6.7%), MPZ (5.3%), and MFN2
(4.3%). GJB1 deletions and mutations in the residual genes were 5.3% of the anomalies. Of
the individuals presenting a positive genetic outcome in a CMT-related gene, 94.9% had a
mutation in one of the following four genes ( PMP22 ,GJB1 ,MPZ , orMFN2 ) [8]. Effective pharmacological treatments for CMT are currently lacking. This review dis-
cusses the treatment of CMT with the four main causative genes.

Next, we asked whether the disease biomarkers identified in 
the C22 transcriptomic study can be confirmed in the CMT1A rat 
model. Consistent with findings in C22 mice, the mRNA levels of lipid biosynthetic genes such as Sc5d and Ugt8a were decreased in CMT1A rats, although to a lesser extent than in C22 mouse nerves. ASO6 treatment trended toward increased mRNA levels of these genes (Figure 3G). Furthermore, the mRNA levels of Id2  
and Bzw2  were significantly increased in CMT1A rats compared 
with WT rats and were substantially decreased following ASO6 treatment (Figure 3G). Finally, we sought to identify a target engagement biomarker 
in the CMT1A rats. Toward this end, we collected blood and foot -
pad skin biopsies from treated CMT1A rats. Although there was detectable rat Pmp22 mRNA in the blood, there was no change in Pmp22 levels following ASO6 treatment (Supplemental Fig -
ure 5E). The level of rat Pmp22 mRNA in the footpad (containing dermal nerves and Schwann cells) was significantly reduced in ASO6- compared with control-treated rats, suggesting this could serve as a biomarker of target engagement (Figure 3H).

To obtain better insights into the under -
lying pathogenic mechanisms in CMT1A, we investigated the role of PMP22 duplication in cellular homeostasis in 
CMT1A mouse models and in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated into Schwann cell precur -
sors (iPSC-SCPs). We performed lipidomic profiling and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on sciatic nerves of two developing CMT1A 
mouse models and on CMT1A patient-derived iPSC-SCPs. For the sciatic nerves of the CMT1A mice, cholesterol 
and lipid metabolism was downregulated in a dose-dependent manner throughout development. For the CMT1A 
iPSC-SCPs, transcriptional analysis unveiled a strong suppression of genes related to autophagy and lipid metabol -
ism. Gene ontology enrichment analysis identified disturbances in pathways related to plasma membrane compo -
nents and cell receptor signalling. Lipidomic analysis confirmed the severe dysregulation in plasma membrane 
lipids, particularly sphingolipids, in CMT1A iPSC-SCPs. Furthermore, we identified reduced lipid raft dynamics, dis -
turbed plasma membrane fluidity and impaired cholesterol incorporation and storage, all of which could result from 
altered lipid storage homeostasis in the patient-derived CMT1A iPSC-SCPs.

The only network in MYC HME cells
associated with metabolism was “lipid metabolism ”(IPA Network

that some of the most signi ﬁcantly altered canonical signalling
pathways (377 genes; FDR < 5%; Min. fold: 6.81) in MYC HME cellswere involved in lipid metabolism, including atherosclerosissignalling, LXR/RXR activation, and PPAR signalling (Fig. 2b, black

different genes (Supplementary Table S4) associated with lipid
metabolism across TERT, MYC, and HER2 HME cells revealed asigni ﬁcant enrichment of upregulation in MYC versus TERT (1.4-
fold over all upregulated genes, p=5×1 0

acyl-CoA metabolism, mitochondrial β-oxidation, and lipases. Our
ﬁndings agree with Camarda et al. who also reported a strong
representation of fatty acid metabolism genes in TNBC patients.10
We next performed a lipidomic analysis that revealed that
phosphatidylcholine (PC) and cardiolipin contained longer, moreunsaturated fatty acyl chains compared to TERT cells (Supple-mentary Fig.

How can PMP22  overexpression  change  MYC expression  as rationalized by chatGPT  
 
Certainly! Let’s explore how overexpression of  PMP22 
(Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 ) could influence  MYC expression, considering mechanisms 
in cell biology and biochemistry . Backgroun d 
• PMP2 2 is a transmembrane glycoprotein primarily 
expressed in Schwann cells, contributing to myelin 
sheath formation. It is also involved in regulating cell 
growth, adhesion, and apoptosis. • MYC is a transcription factor that regulates genes 
involved in proliferation , metabolism, and apoptosis. Possible Mechanisms Linking PMP22 
Overexpression to MYC Expressio n 
1. Altered Signaling Pathway s: 
• PMP22 is known to interact with signaling pathways, particularly those involving cell 
growth and differentiation. Overexpressi on may activate or inhibit signaling cascades 
like PI3K -AKT or MAP K. 
• These pathways can modulate  MYC expression directly or indirectly through upstream 
regulators such as  mTO R or transcription factors like  NF-κB.

To test the efficacy of ASO6 in reducing rat Pmp22 mRNA, 
we treated 6-week-old CMT1A rats weekly for 12 weeks with PBS, control ASO (12.5 mg/kg), or ASO6 (12.5 mg/kg) and sacrificed the rats following electrophysiological testing performed 1 week in RT4-D6P2T cells and in vivo screening of ASOs in Sprague- Dawley rats and identified an active ASO (ASO6) that effectively suppressed rat Pmp22 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on mouse Pmp22 mRNA (Supplemental Figure 5,

A consistent slow NCV of < 38 m/s in the
arms represents the demyelinating form of CMT1, whereas a value >38 m/s is distinctive
of the axonal form of CMT2. Transitional NCVs (25–45 m/s) are often observed in males
with CMTX1 and in patients with other transitional patterns of CMT [4]. The genetic diagnosis of CMT has been conducted by implementing the targeted next-
generation sequencing and whole-exome sequencing approaches. Over 120 gene mutations
are related to the pathogenesis of CMT and associated neuropathies [ 5,6]. The frequency of
the various types of CMT varies by region and the age at which they were published. In
the study by Saporta et al., 787 out of 1024 patients were diagnosed with CMT; a genetic
subtype was identiﬁed in 527 (67%) of these patients, while the remaining 260 patients did
not present with any identiﬁable mutation. Among the genetically deﬁned cases, CMT1A
(PMP22 ) emerged as the most prevalent subtype, comprising 55% of the cases, followed
by CMTX1 ( GJB1 ; 15.2%), hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP;

Identification of 
a well- established marker of axonal disease, G3BP1, substantiates 
the notion that irrespective of the cellular origin of the neuropathy, 
the dynamic interplay between the axon and myelinated glia is per-
turbed early- on in affected nerves. This unbiased global proteomic study confirms our previous 
work on the involvement of degradative pathways in PMP22-  
linked neuropathies (Fortun et al., 2003; Notterpek et al., 1997). Since PMP22, the disease- causing protein, is prone to aggregation 
when mutated or overexpressed (Notterpek, Ryan, et al., 1999), 
the mistrafficked protein induces a proteostatic dysbalance (Fortun 
et al., 2003). Dysregulated proteins identified in this study include 
autophagy- related cathepsins B, C, D, and Z, lysosomal- associated 
membrane protein 2, and several other molecules that comprise the 
lysosome and proteasome pathways (Figures 5 and 6 ). Recent ev-
idence suggests that the close regulation of autophagy is directly 
related to the pathobiology of neurodegeneration and is linked 
to the clearance of intracellular waste in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, 
and Huntington's diseases (Song et al., 2021).

Approximately 350 GO terms corresponding 
to biological processes, ~130 terms representing cellular components, 
and ~70 denoting molecular functions demonstrated significant enrich-
ment from the differentially expressed protein pool (not shown). Of 
the top ten enriched biological processes, four are related to RNA me-
tabolism, three to dopamine processing, and two are involved in axon 
development. One in macromolecule catabolic processing (Figure 2c). Enriched cellular components reflect the axonal changes within the sci-
atic nerves of neuropathic mice, with five out of the top ten GO terms 
correlating with nerve axon- related cellular components (Figure 2d). Additionally, nine of the top ten molecular functions enriched within 
the affected samples are associated with RNA and nucleic acid activi-
ties (Figure 2e). Based on these analyses, we further examined enriched myelin and axonal gene products (Figures 3 and 4 ), as well as the top 
three augmented protein networks, namely the proteasome, lysosome, 
and spliceosome pathways (Figure 5–7).

Astro -
cytes are also known to influence oligodendrocyte development by 
modulating the availability of growth factors and nutrients required for 
oligodendrocyte differentiation [4]. Astrocyte activation in response to 
CNS injury can have both protective and detrimental effects on overall 
neuronal survival and myelination [5]. In this study, we aimed to study 
the effect of hypoxia on astrocytes to delineate the pathways that could 
potentially impact oligodendrocyte maturation. Transcriptomic analysis of human fetal neural stem cell-derived as-
trocytes subjected to hypoxia demonstrated the upregulation of 
cholesterol biosynthetic pathways. These findings were validated by 
measuring the gene and protein expression of cholesterol synthetic and 
transport proteins in FNSC-derived astrocytes and in a cell line model. Astrocyte cholesterol content and efflux was also increased in response 
to hypoxia. However, premyelinating oligodendrocytes did not

These findings were consistent with the motor behavior and electrophysiology charac-terizations of the C22 cohort described in Figure 1. This was, to our knowledge, the first RNA-seq profiling of 
a CMT1A model, and the analysis showed some categories of 
genes in common with microarray profiles of other CMT1A mod-
els (34, 37 , 38). For example, there was a significant decrease in cholesterol and lipid biosynthetic genes as well as myelin-related genes in 5-week-old C22 compared with WT littermates (Supple -
mental Figure 2, C and F). The increased gene categories include a number involved in cell signaling, as well as those involved in axon guidance mechanisms (RhoA , Plxna1, and Rac1 ) and inte -
grin signaling (Itgb8 ) (Supplemental Figure 2D). Expression of 
myelin inhibitors such as Id2 , Id4, and Ednrb  was also increased, 
suggesting an unfavorable environment for remyelination (Sup -
plemental Figure 2E). Dysregulation of several transcription fac-tors regulating Schwann cell differentiation was also observed in the C22 mice (Supplemental Figure 2F).

Nonetheless, there is still no pharmacological treatment 
available for any CMT type. However, the landscape is rapidly evolving and several novel approaches 
are providing encouraging results in preclinical studies and leading to clinical trials. Areas covered : The authors review the most promising therapies under study and the ongoing/ 
planned clinical trials. Several approaches to address PMP22 overexpression underlying CMT1A, the 
most frequent subtype, are being tested. Gene silencing, targeting PMP22, and gene therapy, to 
introduce specific genes or to substitute or modulate defective ones, are being experimented in animal 
models. Compounds acting on ER stress, unfolded protein response, neuregulin pathways, phosphoi -
nositides metabolism, axonal transport and degeneration, inflammation, polyol pathway, deoxysphin -
golipid metabolism, purine nucleotide pool are potential therapeutic candidates for different forms of 
CMT and related neuropathies. Expert opinion : We are getting closer to find effective therapies for CMT, but are far behind the 
exciting examples of other genetic neuromuscular disorders.

1a and Supplementary Table 4). APOE4-dysregulated processes included upregulation of inflam -
matory and immune-related pathways in several cell types, includ -
ing NF-к B signalling in excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons and 
OPCs; T cell receptor and cytokine signalling in astrocytes; and 
tumour-necrosis-factor-mediated signalling in microglia and excitatory 
neurons (Fig. 1a). We also observed downregulation of synaptic-related 
processes, including ion channel activity, excitatory postsynaptic poten -
tial and synaptic plasticity (Fig. 1a). Notably, these alterations not only 
occurred in neurons (for example, voltage-gated calcium channel activ -
ity), but also in oligodendrocytes (for example, long-term neuronal 
synaptic plasticity). In APOE4 excitatory neurons, we identified upregu -
lation of ERK1/2 signalling (such as MAPK1 , MAP2K1  and MAP2K2 ) and 
endosomal-related transport (such as RAB21  and SNX12) genes (Sup -

roles of APOE4 in inflammation, synaptic impairment, MAPK1 signalling 
and downstream APP transcription and early endosomes7,18.

Indeed, we are still with -
out any drug treatment for CMT and there is no major impact 
on real world coming from ongoing research, yet. Which are the reasons for the gap with the other neuro -
muscular disorders? There are several contributing factors. The 
peripheral nerves are intrinsically more difficult to study as 
compared to the muscles and even to the motor neurons: it is 
problematic to obtain nerve tissue to be studied and charac -
terized, Schwann cells and myelination studies are particularly 
challenging, and it is currently extremely hard if not impossi -
ble to obtain reliable Schwann cells from iPSCs. It is also 
arduous to target drugs and gene therapies to the peripheral 
nerves, particularly to correct Schwann cell defects. Other 
reasons are constituted by: the great genetic heterogeneity 
of this group of diseases, with about 100 genes and loci 
involved in CMT and related neuropathies; the great variability 
of disease expression, with different phenotype severity 708

Differential pathway activity analysis. To minimize the discovery 
of false positive effects, activity scores were computed only after fil -
tering out genes that were not expressed in a given cell type (defined 
as a nonzero detection rate ≥10%, see Supplementary Table 2 for a 
full list of expressed genes per cell type). For each pathway-cell type 
combination, pathway activity scores were modelled using a multivari -
ate linear model as follows: pathway activity ~β0 × APOE4 + β1 × amy -
loid + β2 × nft + β3 × age_death + β4 × msex + β5 × pmi. Here, APOE4 is a 
binary variable, encoding the presence of at least one E4 allele. Amyloid 
and nft are averages of continuous measurements of pathology across 8 
and 5 brain regions, respectively, as evaluated and reported by ROSMAP. Age_death is a continuous measurement indicating age at death, pmi 
represents the PMI (a continuous measurement) and sex is a binary 
variable encoding biological sex. β0 represents the additive effect 
of APOE4 (≥1 allele) on pathway activity, when accounting for other confounding variables that might be correlated with, and therefore 
explain, a portion of the variation observed in the activity of a pathway 
of interest.

Finally, other CMT proteins interact with the F-actin cytoskeleton such as PRX (CMT4F) or regulates its assembly, such as FGD4, a GEF for Cdc42 GTPase, which is mutated in the autosomal recessive CMT4H. In conclusion, the generation and characterization of ani -
mal models for these neuropathies as well as the increasing number of IPN genes identified using NGS (next generation sequencing) technologies has enormously contributed to expand and deep our knowledge on myelin biology. In turn, the knowledge of the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms allowed to design and validate at the preclinical level prom-ising therapeutical approaches, which can be potentially translated to human in a near future [129– 133].

ontology (GO) enrichment analysis identified the PM component 
(GO component), receptor signalling and activity (GO function) 
and cell adhesion (GO process) as the core pathways enriched in 
CMT1A iPSC-SCPs (Fig. 4B). These data indicate early transcription -
al dysregulation in the CMT1A iPSC-SCPs, altering the transcrip -

lipid profiles in CMT1A, we performed a detailed lipidomic analysis 
on CMT1A and isogenic iPSC-SCPs. The PCA score plot, based on the 
measured lipid concentrations, showed a clear difference between 
CMT1A and isogenic iPSC-SCPs (Fig. 4C). Specifically, CMT1A 
iPSC-SCPs exhibited significantly lower levels of SM compared 
with the isogenic controls. Furthermore, CMT1A iPSC-SCPs had 
lower levels of Cer, HexCer and Dh-Cer but, in most cases, without 
reaching statistical significance.

marking the transitions from iPSCs to early neural crest cells, SCPs and, ultimately, Schwann cells (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Figs 2

genes essential to Schwann cell lineage development (Fig. 3C). We 
also observed that these iPSC-SCs were capable of producing myelin when co-cultured with mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons (Fig. 3D). Bulk RNA-seq indicated that the transcriptome of CMT1A and 
isogenic iPSC-SCPs was similar to that of neural crest progenitors

However, while high-fat diet can partially compensate for a deﬁciency in fatty
acid synthesis in the CNS, in the PNS a high fat diet results in worsening of myelin defects when fatty
acid synthesis is impaired [ 110,111]. The mechanisms underlying di erential e ects in the CNS vs.
PNS remain to be determined. Taken together the current literature suggests that the uptake of fatty
acid may not be the primary pathway for myelin formation. However, the importance of fatty acid
uptake contributing to the energetic metabolism of myelinating cells and axonal trophic support is
still unclear. Finally, there is also new evidence that lipids could be provided to myelin cells by neurons. A recent study found that fatty acids are released by hyperactive neurons and can be taken up by
neighboring glia to protect neurons from fatty acid toxicity [158]. 11. Fatty Acid Oxidation
The nervous system has very high metabolic demands. Notably the CNS consumes 20% of
the body’s oxygen supply. While the metabolic requirements for neural activity have been well
characterized, the energetic requirement for myelin formation and maintenance, as well as the
mechanisms for energetic production in myelinating cells, are not well understood [ 159].

[25]. mRNA expression of both lipid catabolizing and anabolizing transcripts were affected. This study further
showed that during development, lipid metabolism genes (including those of sterol metabolism) failed to
up-regulate in a CMT1A background compared with WT, suggesting a failure to engage lipid synthesis during
myelination. Lipidomics studies conducted on CMT1A rats and human serum samples [ 26] found that rat sciatic nerves
exhibited impaired sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism in which ceramides, sphingomyelins,
hexosylceramides, and sphingosine were all reduced in CMT1A samples [ 26]. An earlier study also found these

species [ 25,26]. The two studies tested regimens of lipid supplementation (by either adding lipids or various
components of different lipid biosynthetic pathways) and observed improvements in myelination. A transcriptomic analysis of C3 (CMT1A model) mice found that the most severely down-regulated genes
were those involved in cholesterol biosynthesis [ 27].

cell-type-specific activity, yet a subset was active across all major cell types, suggesting the potential for both cell-type-specific and

Thus, by analogy with epithelial cell polar -
ity, the abaxonal membrane of myelinated fibers is defined as a basolateral-like region, whereas the adaxonal membrane, SLI, paranodes and microvilli are considered apical-like regions [18, 19]. Schwann Cell Development
During early vertebrate development, neural crest cells delaminate from the neural tube, proliferate, and migrate to generate a broad spectrum of cell types including, among others, Schwann cells, melanocytes, sympathetic neurons, sensory neurons, and skeletal and connective tissues of the head [24– 26]. The cell fate largely depends from the region 
of origin of the neural tube from which neural crest cells migrate. These regions are defined in an anterior–posterior axis direction as cranial, cardiac, vagal, trunk, and sacral. In particular, Schwann cells, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons, sympathetic neurons, and satellite cells associated with sensory neurons, all originate from ventrally migrating trunk neural crest cells [27].

Longitudinal RNA-seq experiments [ 25] found that lipid biosynthetic processes (phospholipid, cholesterol,
and glycosphingolipid genes) were among the most prominently down-regulated transcripts in CMT1A rats
during postnatal development (for a complete list of genes see Supplementary Figure S1 of Fledrich et al.

Feedback Loops and MicroRNA Regulatio n: 
• MYC expression is tightly regulated by feedback loops and microRNAs. PMP22 may alter 
the expression of specific microRNAs that target MYC, such as  let-7 or miR-34a, 
thereby affecting MYC levels . Experimental Validatio n 
 
To establish a causal relationship, you could:  
• Use Western blottin g or qPC R to measure MYC expression after PMP22 overexpression . • Apply  pharmacological inhibitor s or genetic tools (e.g., CRISPR) to block suspected 
signaling pat hways and observe changes in MYC expression . • Assess the role of ER stress markers (e.g., CHOP, BiP) to link PMP22 overexpression to 
UPR . By understanding these mechanisms, you might 
uncover novel insights into cellular stress, growth, and 
oncogenic tran sformation driven by PMP22 
overexpression.

CMT1A exhibits dysregulated lipid biosynthesis
Comparative microarrays were used to compare gene expression from sciatic nerves of WT rats with mildly and
severely affected CMT1A model rats expressing a 3rd WT PMP22 allele [ 24]. It was found that dysregulation of
22 lipid metabolism genes correlated with disease severity. In both mildly and severely affected animals mostexamined lipid metabolism genes were down-regulated at both 1 week and 9 weeks of age. Interestingly, there
was an age-dependent switch between mildly affected and severely affected rats with mildly affected rats exhibit-
ing more lipid biosynthetic gene dysregulation at 1 week of age and severely affected rats exhibiting more lipidbiosynthesis gene dysregulation at 9 weeks of age. Follow-up quantitative PCR experiments validated Adipoq,
Lpl, Scd1, Pparg, Prkar2b, Ssg1, and Thrsp as being dysregulated. Figure 1. Cartoon representation for the AlphaFold2-predicted structure of PMP22. Highlighted are locations of the CRAC motif in TM4 (residues 147 –159, red), CARC motif in TM3 (residues 92 –104, blue), and

In the outbred rat model of CMT1A,22rats can have varying 
levels of rodent Pmp22 expression, giving rise to a spectrum of pheno -
type severities, including variations in the expression of lipid 
metabolism-related genes.22,49To understand how these transcrip -
tional changes influence the CMT1A lipid profiles, we performed lipi-
domics on the sciatic nerves of 5-week-old C3 mice. Overall, the 
analysis revealed a major downregulation of lipid species in general, 
particularly of SPs, with SMs being the most affected in the sciatic 
nerves of C3 mice compared with their age-matched littermate con-
trols. In further support of these alterations, CMT1A rat sciatic nerve 
myelin exhibited significantly reduced levels of total cholesterol, PC, 
PE, plasmalogens, SM and ceramides.49
The correct PM lipid composition is essential for Schwann cells to 
interact with axons and to produce myelin, the multilamellar lipid- 
based structure. During Schwann cell lineage development, neural 
crest cells give rise to SCPs, which are guided to the most distal regions 
of the body by the extending peripheral axons.51Once interacting with 
axons, SCPs can differentiate into immature Schwann cells, which or-
ganize axons to be myelinated and non-myelinated in a process de-
fined as radial sorting.52To investigate the cellular origins of CMT1A 
lipid alterations, we developed a protocol to derive a Schwann cell lin-
eage from iPSCs.

Schwann cells express Sox10 at all stages of development 
as early as in migratory neural crest cells before lineage specification, thus suggesting that Sox10 is a key determi-nant of Schwann cell identity [41, 42]. Sox10 is also crucial 
in terminal differentiation and in myelin maintenance, as it controls the expression of several myelin genes encoding P0, MBP, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and Cx32 [33]. Conditional deletion in adult nerves showed that Sox10 
is also required for myelin homeostasis to maintain myelin integrity [43]. In mutant mice lacking Oct6, myelin genes are repressed 
and myelination is blocked [44, 45]. A double Oct6/Brn2  
KO model shows a more severe phenotype as compared to single Oct6 KO, thus suggesting that these factors cooperate 
to promote the transition to a myelinating phenotype. Even if more severe than the single KO, in Oct6/Brn2, double KO myelination is delayed but not completely blocked [46]. This finding led to the hypothesis that another factor such as Brn1 can in part compensate loss of Oct6 in vivo [47].

This results in altered lipidomes, as
found in both animal and human derived samples. Combined, these data show that in CMTD SCs are unable to
generate the necessary lipids of myelin production and that this begins at the level of gene expression. PMP22 interacts with cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes
In their efforts to describe the glycosylation-dependent traf ﬁcking of PMP22 through the secretory phway to
the cell surface, Marinko et al. [ 29] conducted quantitative proteomics to identify PMP22 interactors. Some 56
proteins were seen to co-immunoprecipitate (co-IP) with WT PMP22, some of which were previously-documented PMP22 interactors, with many others on pathways (e.g. membrane protein integration, ER chaper-
one network, and ERAD degradation) that make sense based on what we know about the cellular traf ﬁcking
itinerary of PMP22. Included among these 56 proteins were PGRMC1, EMC4, DHCR7, DHCR24, TMEM97,and SURF4. All are related to cholesterol biosynthesis and cholesterol traf ﬁcking. Except for SURF4 and
TMEM97, the other four PMP22 interactors are related to cholesterol biosynthesis in the ER, constituting bio-
synthetic steps taking place after squalene synthesis ( Figure 2A )[30,31].

increased expression of HIF1 α on Western blot (Fig. 1a). After appro -

and cholesterol biosynthetic pathways (normalised enrichment score 
(NES) 2.35, adjusted p-value 0.004) were positively enriched in hypoxic 
astrocytes (Fig. 1c). Pathway analysis (Supplementary table S5 and S6) 
showed the positive enrichment of HIF 1 signaling pathway (NES 2.06,

In both cases, a single, continuous basal lamina covers 
these neuron-satellite glia units, which are separated from each other by 
connective tissue (Pannese, 2010 ). During development, SGCs are 
derived from neural crest cells and likely furthermore originate from 
boundary cap cells (Jessen and Mirsky, 2005 ; Marol et al., 2004 ). As 
SGCs share several similarities with SC precursor cells, they have been 
suggested to represent a population of developmentally arrested SCs 
(George et al., 2018 ). Though, other studies demonstrate a molecular 
profile more reminiscent to astrocytes (Avraham et al., 2020 ; Jager 
et al., 2020 ; van Weperen et al., 2021 ) and emphasize overlapping 
functions to astrocytes in the CNS (Hanani and Spray, 2020 ; Huang 
et al., 2013 ). However, satellite glial cells were shown to also express 
unique genes that are absent in SCs and astrocytes (Mapps et al., 2022 ). Recent RNA-sequencing studies identified a pronounced M. Bosch-Queralt et al. Neurobiology of Disease 176 (2023) 105952

Because neuronal upregulation of genes related to choles-
terol metabolism could be a general response to chronic myelinalterations, we analyzed transcriptional proﬁles of isolated
cortical neurons following acute experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) induction and following acute-phase(6 weeks of cuprizone) and chronic-phase remyelination
(12 weeks of cuprizone followed by 2 weeks of cuprizone with-
drawal, 12+2 weeks) ( Figure 2 D). During acute disease (EAE or
6 weeks of cuprizone), neurons consistently downregulated
gene expression related to cholesterol metabolism ( Figure 2 E). In contrast, during remyelination following chronic demyelin-ation in the cuprizone model, expression of genes involved in
cholesterol metabolism was increased ( Figure 2 E;Table S3 ). To test whether the upregulation of cholesterol synthesis geneswas functionally relevant, we determined the abundance of ste-rols by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry
(GC/MS) in the chronic remyelination paradigm.

Perisynaptic SCs have also been 
shown to promote the functional recovery of injured NMJs via secretion 
of CXCL12 α and an interaction with CXCR4 on axon terminals (Negro

remodelling of the neuromuscular junctions after injury, and limited 
reinnervation (Hastings et al., 2020 ). Notably, a recent study demon -
strates that injury induced functional changes of perisynaptic SC,

SC persist for at least 60 days after injury (Perez-Gonzalez et al., 2022 ). 4.2. Schwann cells of the skin

Myelin Biology

Abstract
Myelin is a key evolutionary specialization and adaptation of vertebrates formed by the plasma membrane of glial cells, which insulate axons in the nervous system. Myelination not only allows rapid and efficient transmission of electric impulses in the axon by decreasing capacitance and increasing resistance but also influences axonal metabolism and the plasticity of neural circuits. In this review, we will focus on Schwann cells, the glial cells which form myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we will describe the main extrinsic and intrinsic signals inducing Schwann cell differentiation and myelination and how myelin biogenesis is achieved. Finally, we will also discuss how the study of human disorders in which molecules and pathways relevant for myelination are altered has enormously contributed to the current knowledge on myelin biology.

Therefore, the overexpression of these genes may
have a therapeutic effect on CMT1B. 3.2.9. Colony-Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor Inhibitor
The neuropathic phenotype is promoted by low-grade inﬂammation from phagocytiz-
ing macrophages in mice models for CMT1A, CMT1B, and CMTX1. Colony-stimulating
factor (CSF1) is a macrophage activator expressed by endoneurial ﬁbroblasts. It mediates
macrophage-related neural impairment in mice and humans with CMT. Consequently, oral
administration of the CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX5622 followed by a vigorous
decrease in the number of macrophages in the peripheral nerves of Cx32def mice; more-
over, long-term CSF1R inhibition was reported to improve axonal integrity in these mice. However, although long-term CSF1R inhibition reduced the neuropathic patterns in P0het
mutants, it did not produce the same effect in PMP22 tg mutants [52]. 3.2.10. Sodium Channel Blockers
Dysmyelination in Mpz knockout mice associates with the ectopic expression of the

How-
ever, the exact contribution of these enzymes to these respective
pathways is still not all that clear. Similarly, some of the AGPAT (acyl-
glycero-phosphate acyl transferase) enzymes that catalyze the acylation
of lyso-phospholipids are found in the outer mitochondrial membrane
(e.g. AGPAT4 and AGPAT5) [ 3], whereas others are found in the ER. AGPAT enzymes are mostly believed to use lyso-PA to generate PA inthe de novo lipid synthetic pathway, but which isozymes are most
important for phospholipid synthesis is not yet known. Interestingly,
Agpat4−/−mice show signi ﬁcant decreases in phosphatidylinositol
(PI), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) butnot in phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphati-
dylglycerol (PG) or cardiolipin levels in the brain [ 6]; suggesting that
PA made on the outer surface of the mitochondria by this enzyme has toﬁnd its way to the ER, where the a ﬀected phospholipids are known to
be made, and that not all phospholipid synthetic pathways are fed
uniformly through the action of this enzyme.

In the cortex, con-
ditional inactivation of cholesterol synthesis in neurons or oligo-dendrocytes resulted in moderate upregulation of cholesterol
synthesis genes, possibly to compensate for the loss of choles-
terol synthesis in the affected cell type ( Figure 1 E;Table S2 ). In
contrast, in all conditional mutants, we observed a moderatebut consistent downregulation of expression related to choles-
terol metabolism in white matter ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and S1
H). Here, reduced expression of genes associated with cholesteroltransport was noted in all conditional mutants, particularly in
AcKO animals ( Figure 1 F). In agreement, sterol proﬁling revealed
only moderate alteration in conditional mutants ( Figure S2 A). Surprisingly, corpus callosum of OLcKO and NcKO mice re-
vealed a marked downregulation of genes related to the blood-
brain barrier (BBB). This was accompanied by upregulation ofa few inﬂammatory mediators with proﬁles being unique toeach mutant ( Figures 1 E and 1F). Interestingly, by biochemical
quantiﬁcation of BBB permeability, the reduced tight junction
gene expression was paralleled by increased CNS inﬂux of thesmall-molecular-weight BBB tracer sodium ﬂuorescein (NaFl;
376 Da) in OLcKO and NcKO brains.

Transcriptional analysis of CMT1A patient iPSC-SCPs showed a 
downregulation of several genes related to Schwann cell myelin -
ation and development. In addition, key lipid metabolism genes 
were downregulated, including the cholesterol efflux transporters 
ATP binding cassette subfamily A 1 (ABCA1) and ABCA3. PMP22 is 
known to regulate ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux, because 
Pmp22 knockout drastically upregulated ABCA1 and led to LD accu -
mulations in the peripheral nerves.17In addition, Zhou et al.55
showed cholesterol sequestration to lysosomes and reduced 
ATP-binding cassette transporter-dependent cholesterol efflux in 
CMT1A patient fibroblasts. In CMT1A iPSC-SCPs, we showed that 
several genes relating to lipid homeostasis and storage were down -
regulated. Interestingly, the autophagy-associated genes LAMP1 and 
LAMP2 were dysregulated, whereas NPC1 and NPC2 were downregu -
lated. NPC1 and NPC2 are intracellular transporters that act in tan-
dem to remove cholesterol from the lysosomal compartment37,39,56
and regulate cholesterol homeostasis through the generation of 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-derived oxysterols.56Loss of 
function of NPC1 or NPC2 proteins is known to cause the lysosomal 
storage disease Niemann–Pick disease, type C1 and 2, respectively.37
GO enrichment analysis revealed dysregulation in genes regu -
lating PM components, transmembrane signalling receptor activity 
and biological adhesion, all of which are essential factors regulating 
axo-glial interactions and myelination maintenance.57,58Lipidomic analysis showed significant alterations in SP in CMT1A 
iPSC-SCPs.

therapies targeting axonal 
degeneration and axonal transport). The first trials with ascorbic acid for CMT1A were ineffective 
and highlighted the difficulties in translating preclinical posi -
tive results into successful clinical studies. The slow progres -
sion of CMT makes it difficult to demonstrate efficacy of any 
tested compound. Hence, research is also aimed at developing 
responsive outcome measures. In this paper we will review the most promising treatment 
in the pipeline as well as the current or planned clinical trials 
for CMT and related neuropathies. There is a wide variety of 
possible therapies under investigation, including those aimed 
at lowering PMP22 overexpression in CMT1A, the gene ther -
apy approaches to substitute, modulate or correct the defec -
tive genes, and compounds acting on the unfolded protein 
response (UPR) activated by misfolded protein accumulation, 
or working on myelination control mechanisms, or functioning 
specifically on metabolic pathways altered in certain CMT 
subtypes, or addressing common pathomechanisms underly -
ing several CMT forms.
