(role: system, content: You are a knowledgeable bioinformatics assistant specializing in gene pathway analysis. Your primary objective is to identify and describe functionally significant gene sets using the user’s provided list of genes. Rather than focusing solely on statistical p-values, consider overall biological relevance, functional coherence, and emerging insights. 
When assisting the user, you should:

1. **Input Acceptance and Data Context**:
   - Accept a list of user-provided genes (symbols or identifiers).
   - If additional analysis text or a proposed pathway/function name is provided, carefully review it to understand the rationale behind suggesting a particular function.

2. **Identifying and Interpreting Pathways**:
   - Identify associated biological pathways, both known and novel, based on the provided information and established literature.
   - Go beyond known annotations by integrating broader literature knowledge and biological reasoning.

3. **Structured Presentation of Results**:
   - Organize identified pathways by their functional relevance and biological plausibility.
   - Present each identified pathway along with the list of all associated genes in the following format:
     Pathway Name:
     Gene A, Gene B, Gene C,

    Pathway Name:
    Gene A, Gene B, Gene C
  - Do not include any additional text or explanations beyond the pathway names and associated genes.
4. **Handling Synonyms and Ambiguities**:
   - Treat acronyms or alternative gene names as equivalent if they refer to the same gene.

5. **Final Output and Interpretative Narrative**:
   - Present findings as a clear, concise list of pathways with their corresponding genes, focusing solely on biological relevance and functional coherence.
   - Do not be bound to a set number of pathways.
   - Avoid narrative summaries, explanations, or detailed gene-level discussions beyond the listing of genes.
   - Ensure the list focuses on pathways directly relevant to the user’s query and integrates potential novel or underexplored pathways.
   - Focus particularly on neural genetic-related pathways.

6. **Do Not Critique the User’s Proposed Name or Analysis**:
   - Base evaluations solely on the user’s data and your domain knowledge.
   - Focus on clarity, coherence, and helpfulness in your response.

---

**Additional Guidelines for Presenting Results**:

- Organize identified pathways by grouping genes into coherent functional categories when possible.
- Provide a comprehensive list of all potential pathways that the genes are present in, including a complete list of associated genes (gene symbols only) for each pathway, even if some genes are less relevant.
- Instead of a simple list of genes and their pathways, focus on a small number of biologically meaningful pathways or themes and show how the genes support these themes.

Differential pathway activity analysis. To minimize the discovery 
of false positive effects, activity scores were computed only after fil -
tering out genes that were not expressed in a given cell type (defined 
as a nonzero detection rate ≥10%, see Supplementary Table 2 for a 
full list of expressed genes per cell type). For each pathway-cell type 
combination, pathway activity scores were modelled using a multivari -
ate linear model as follows: pathway activity ~β0 × APOE4 + β1 × amy -
loid + β2 × nft + β3 × age_death + β4 × msex + β5 × pmi. Here, APOE4 is a 
binary variable, encoding the presence of at least one E4 allele. Amyloid 
and nft are averages of continuous measurements of pathology across 8 
and 5 brain regions, respectively, as evaluated and reported by ROSMAP. Age_death is a continuous measurement indicating age at death, pmi 
represents the PMI (a continuous measurement) and sex is a binary 
variable encoding biological sex. β0 represents the additive effect 
of APOE4 (≥1 allele) on pathway activity, when accounting for other confounding variables that might be correlated with, and therefore 
explain, a portion of the variation observed in the activity of a pathway 
of interest.

Because neuronal upregulation of genes related to choles-
terol metabolism could be a general response to chronic myelinalterations, we analyzed transcriptional proﬁles of isolated
cortical neurons following acute experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) induction and following acute-phase(6 weeks of cuprizone) and chronic-phase remyelination
(12 weeks of cuprizone followed by 2 weeks of cuprizone with-
drawal, 12+2 weeks) ( Figure 2 D). During acute disease (EAE or
6 weeks of cuprizone), neurons consistently downregulated
gene expression related to cholesterol metabolism ( Figure 2 E). In contrast, during remyelination following chronic demyelin-ation in the cuprizone model, expression of genes involved in
cholesterol metabolism was increased ( Figure 2 E;Table S3 ). To test whether the upregulation of cholesterol synthesis geneswas functionally relevant, we determined the abundance of ste-rols by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry
(GC/MS) in the chronic remyelination paradigm.

Indeed, we are still with -
out any drug treatment for CMT and there is no major impact 
on real world coming from ongoing research, yet. Which are the reasons for the gap with the other neuro -
muscular disorders? There are several contributing factors. The 
peripheral nerves are intrinsically more difficult to study as 
compared to the muscles and even to the motor neurons: it is 
problematic to obtain nerve tissue to be studied and charac -
terized, Schwann cells and myelination studies are particularly 
challenging, and it is currently extremely hard if not impossi -
ble to obtain reliable Schwann cells from iPSCs. It is also 
arduous to target drugs and gene therapies to the peripheral 
nerves, particularly to correct Schwann cell defects. Other 
reasons are constituted by: the great genetic heterogeneity 
of this group of diseases, with about 100 genes and loci 
involved in CMT and related neuropathies; the great variability 
of disease expression, with different phenotype severity 708

The only network in MYC HME cells
associated with metabolism was “lipid metabolism ”(IPA Network
4), whose components are shown in Fig. 2a. The IPA also indicated
that some of the most signi ﬁcantly altered canonical signalling
pathways (377 genes; FDR < 5%; Min. fold: 6.81) in MYC HME cellswere involved in lipid metabolism, including atherosclerosissignalling, LXR/RXR activation, and PPAR signalling (Fig. 2b, black
boxes). Gene expression analysis of an unbiased list of 163
different genes (Supplementary Table S4) associated with lipid
metabolism across TERT, MYC, and HER2 HME cells revealed asigni ﬁcant enrichment of upregulation in MYC versus TERT (1.4-
fold over all upregulated genes, p=5×1 0
−8by Fisher Exact Test). Notable functions for those genes were related to lipid transport,
acyl-CoA metabolism, mitochondrial β-oxidation, and lipases. Our
ﬁndings agree with Camarda et al. who also reported a strong
representation of fatty acid metabolism genes in TNBC patients.10
We next performed a lipidomic analysis that revealed that
phosphatidylcholine (PC) and cardiolipin contained longer, moreunsaturated fatty acyl chains compared to TERT cells (Supple-mentary Fig.

A consistent slow NCV of < 38 m/s in the
arms represents the demyelinating form of CMT1, whereas a value >38 m/s is distinctive
of the axonal form of CMT2. Transitional NCVs (25–45 m/s) are often observed in males
with CMTX1 and in patients with other transitional patterns of CMT [4]. The genetic diagnosis of CMT has been conducted by implementing the targeted next-
generation sequencing and whole-exome sequencing approaches. Over 120 gene mutations
are related to the pathogenesis of CMT and associated neuropathies [ 5,6]. The frequency of
the various types of CMT varies by region and the age at which they were published. In
the study by Saporta et al., 787 out of 1024 patients were diagnosed with CMT; a genetic
subtype was identiﬁed in 527 (67%) of these patients, while the remaining 260 patients did
not present with any identiﬁable mutation. Among the genetically deﬁned cases, CMT1A
(PMP22 ) emerged as the most prevalent subtype, comprising 55% of the cases, followed
by CMTX1 ( GJB1 ; 15.2%), hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP;

However, while high-fat diet can partially compensate for a deﬁciency in fatty
acid synthesis in the CNS, in the PNS a high fat diet results in worsening of myelin defects when fatty
acid synthesis is impaired [ 110,111]. The mechanisms underlying di erential e ects in the CNS vs.
PNS remain to be determined. Taken together the current literature suggests that the uptake of fatty
acid may not be the primary pathway for myelin formation. However, the importance of fatty acid
uptake contributing to the energetic metabolism of myelinating cells and axonal trophic support is
still unclear. Finally, there is also new evidence that lipids could be provided to myelin cells by neurons. A recent study found that fatty acids are released by hyperactive neurons and can be taken up by
neighboring glia to protect neurons from fatty acid toxicity [158]. 11. Fatty Acid Oxidation
The nervous system has very high metabolic demands. Notably the CNS consumes 20% of
the body’s oxygen supply. While the metabolic requirements for neural activity have been well
characterized, the energetic requirement for myelin formation and maintenance, as well as the
mechanisms for energetic production in myelinating cells, are not well understood [ 159].

Having established a TNBC model system of isogenic HME cellslines and shown that MYC expression is suf ﬁcient to induce FAO in
HME cells, we next wanted to identify novel targets that might
contribute to the activation of FAO in MYC HME cells. Since MYC is
a transcription factor, we performed NextGen RNA sequencing onTERT, MYC, and HER2 HME cells to gain further insight into
potential mechanisms of how MYC affects FAO in HME cells
(Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Differentially expressed geneswere mapped to networks available in the Ingenuity database.Five networks were identi ﬁed and ranked by a network score
produced by the IPA, that ranged from 30 to 45 (Supplementary
Table S3). The score takes into account the number ofdifferentially expressed genes (FDR < 5%) and the size of thenetwork to approximate the relevance of the network to the
original list of genes.

In the cortex, con-
ditional inactivation of cholesterol synthesis in neurons or oligo-dendrocytes resulted in moderate upregulation of cholesterol
synthesis genes, possibly to compensate for the loss of choles-
terol synthesis in the affected cell type ( Figure 1 E;Table S2 ). In
contrast, in all conditional mutants, we observed a moderatebut consistent downregulation of expression related to choles-
terol metabolism in white matter ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and S1
H). Here, reduced expression of genes associated with cholesteroltransport was noted in all conditional mutants, particularly in
AcKO animals ( Figure 1 F). In agreement, sterol proﬁling revealed
only moderate alteration in conditional mutants ( Figure S2 A). Surprisingly, corpus callosum of OLcKO and NcKO mice re-
vealed a marked downregulation of genes related to the blood-
brain barrier (BBB). This was accompanied by upregulation ofa few inﬂammatory mediators with proﬁles being unique toeach mutant ( Figures 1 E and 1F). Interestingly, by biochemical
quantiﬁcation of BBB permeability, the reduced tight junction
gene expression was paralleled by increased CNS inﬂux of thesmall-molecular-weight BBB tracer sodium ﬂuorescein (NaFl;
376 Da) in OLcKO and NcKO brains.

To obtain better insights into the under -
lying pathogenic mechanisms in CMT1A, we investigated the role of PMP22 duplication in cellular homeostasis in 
CMT1A mouse models and in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated into Schwann cell precur -
sors (iPSC-SCPs). We performed lipidomic profiling and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on sciatic nerves of two developing CMT1A 
mouse models and on CMT1A patient-derived iPSC-SCPs. For the sciatic nerves of the CMT1A mice, cholesterol 
and lipid metabolism was downregulated in a dose-dependent manner throughout development. For the CMT1A 
iPSC-SCPs, transcriptional analysis unveiled a strong suppression of genes related to autophagy and lipid metabol -
ism. Gene ontology enrichment analysis identified disturbances in pathways related to plasma membrane compo -
nents and cell receptor signalling. Lipidomic analysis confirmed the severe dysregulation in plasma membrane 
lipids, particularly sphingolipids, in CMT1A iPSC-SCPs. Furthermore, we identified reduced lipid raft dynamics, dis -
turbed plasma membrane fluidity and impaired cholesterol incorporation and storage, all of which could result from 
altered lipid storage homeostasis in the patient-derived CMT1A iPSC-SCPs.
