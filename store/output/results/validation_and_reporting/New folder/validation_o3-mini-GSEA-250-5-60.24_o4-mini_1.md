## g:Profiler Comparison Summary
Below is the comparison of your five GPT‐derived neurobiological pathways against the ground‐truth gProfiler list. Loose similarity was used to call a “hit” when a biologically related term was present. All five pathways find counterparts in the annotation set, though some sub-processes (e.g. glial differentiation, cytoskeletal remodeling) are only indirectly represented.

| Pathway (GPT List)                                | Validation | Novel or Common | Matched Pathway (gProfiler List)         | Annotation Term        |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling                   | Hit        | Common          | cell surface receptor signaling pathway   | GO:0007166             |
| Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity             | Hit        | Common          | Axon guidance                             | KEGG:04360             |
| Myelination & Glial Differentiation               | Hit        | Common          | myelin sheath                             | GO:0043209             |
| Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport   | Hit        | Common          | vesicle                                   | GO:0031982             |
| Neurogenesis & Neural Development                 | Hit        | Common          | anatomical structure development          | GO:0048856             |

Summary:
- Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling maps onto receptor‐mediated signaling (GO:0007166), a key driver of synaptic strength changes.
- Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity directly corresponds to the KEGG Axon guidance pathway (04360), central to neural wiring.
- Myelination & Glial Differentiation is captured by the myelin sheath annotation (GO:0043209); although “glial differentiation” per se isn’t explicitly listed, myelin production reflects oligodendrocyte activity.
- Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport aligns with vesicle‐based transport (GO:0031982), a major route for moving cargo along the cytoskeleton.
- Neurogenesis & Neural Development is subsumed under anatomical structure development (GO:0048856), encompassing the formation of new neurons and tissues.

The absence of exact terms for “glial differentiation” and “cytoskeletal remodeling” likely reflects under-representation of those specific gene sets in the gProfiler results, rather than a true lack of biological relevance.

Summary:
- All seven genes carry GO annotations from GeneCards consistent with roles in synaptic transmission, assembly or plasticity.
- Peer-reviewed literature directly linking to synaptic plasticity & signaling was found for Sipa1l1 (Pak et al. 2001) and Mef2c (Flavell et al. 2006).
- For Prss12, Synpr, Lrrtm3, Cntn6 and Efna5, no specific academic papers explicitly demonstrating their involvement in synaptic plasticity & signaling were identified in the surveyed databases, indicating gaps in direct experimental validation.

Summary:
- GeneCards GO annotations support a role in axon guidance (GO:0007411) or related guidance processes for Sema4f, Sema3g, Ntn1, Robo2, Slit2, Srgap1, Plxnb1, Dpysl3 and Dpysl5; Cdh13 shows cell‐adhesion annotations but lacks specific axon‐guidance GO terms.
- Academic‐literature evidence robustly confirms Ntn1, Robo2 and Slit2 in axon‐guidance mechanisms.  
- No direct peer‐reviewed articles were identified linking Sema4f, Sema3g, Srgap1, Plxnb1, Dpysl3, Dpysl5 or Cdh13 explicitly to “Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity,” indicating gaps in targeted experimental validation for these genes.

Summary:
- All seven genes carry Gene Ontology annotations for “myelination,” confirming BioCarta’s assignment to the Myelination & Glial Differentiation pathway.
- Only PMP22 has a directly verifiable peer-reviewed paper linking it to peripheral myelin formation via gene dosage effects (CMT1A duplication).
- For MPZ, MAG, PRX, DRP2, GLDN and MAL, no specific academic paper was found that explicitly ties each gene to “Myelination & Glial Differentiation” under that exact terminology, revealing a gap between GO-based annotations and directly cited functional studies in the literature.

Summary:
- Both GeneCards GO annotations and peer‐reviewed literature support roles for TUBA4A and KIF1A in cytoskeletal dynamics and intracellular transport.
- Although TUBB4A, SEPTIN4, SEPTIN5, PFN2, and RAB10 have GO terms consistent with these processes, no gene-specific academic papers explicitly linking them to “Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport” were identified.
- Further experimental or literature validation is recommended for these five genes to confirm their involvement in this pathway.

Summary:
- GeneCards GO annotations show that all eleven genes carry ontology terms tied to neurogenesis and neural development.
- Peer-reviewed literature verification was found for NES (Nestin) and NUMB, both with clear roles in neural stem/progenitor behavior.
- For the remaining nine genes (Id2, Dyrk1a, Atf5, Klf9, Msi1, Peg3, Igfbp3, Lifr, Cxcl12), no directly matching, verified articles explicitly linking them to “neurogenesis & neural development” were identified in PubMed or Google Scholar.
- Gap: further targeted literature review may uncover relevant studies, particularly for well-studied regulators such as DYRK1A or MSI1, whose roles in neurogenesis are suspected but require precise citations.
