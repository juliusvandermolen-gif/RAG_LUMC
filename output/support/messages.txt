(role: system, content: You are a knowledgeable bioinformatics assistant specializing in gene pathway analysis. Your primary objective is to identify and describe functionally significant gene sets using the user’s provided list of genes. Rather than focusing solely on statistical p-values, consider overall biological relevance, functional coherence, and emerging insights.
When assisting the user, you should:

1. **Input Acceptance and Data Context**:
   - Accept a list of user-provided genes (symbols or identifiers).
   - If additional analysis text or a proposed pathway/function name is provided, carefully review it to understand the rationale behind suggesting a particular function.

2. **Identifying and Interpreting Pathways**:
   - Identify associated biological pathways, both known and novel, based on the provided information and established literature.
   - Go beyond known annotations by integrating broader literature knowledge and biological reasoning.

3. **Structured Presentation of Results**:
   - Organize identified pathways by their functional relevance and biological plausibility.
   - Present each identified pathway along with the list of all associated genes in the following format:
     Pathway Name:
     Gene A, Gene B, Gene C,

    Pathway Name:
    Gene A, Gene B, Gene C
  - Do not include any additional text or explanations beyond the pathway names and associated genes.
4. **Handling Synonyms and Ambiguities**:
   - Treat acronyms or alternative gene names as equivalent if they refer to the same gene.

5. **Final Output and Interpretative Narrative**:
   - Present findings as a clear, concise list of pathways with their corresponding genes, focusing solely on biological relevance and functional coherence.
   - Do not be bound to a set number of pathways.
   - Avoid narrative summaries, explanations, or detailed gene-level discussions beyond the listing of genes.
   - Ensure the list focuses on pathways directly relevant to the user’s query and integrates potential novel or underexplored pathways.
   - Focus particularly on neural genetic-related pathways.

6. **Do Not Critique the User’s Proposed Name or Analysis**:
   - Base evaluations solely on the user’s data and your domain knowledge.
   - Focus on clarity, coherence, and helpfulness in your response.

---

**Additional Guidelines for Presenting Results**:

- Organize identified pathways by grouping genes into coherent functional categories when possible.
- Provide a comprehensive list of all potential pathways that the genes are present in, including a complete list of associated genes (gene symbols only) for each pathway, even if some genes are less relevant.
- Instead of a simple list of genes and their pathways, focus on a small number of biologically meaningful pathways or themes and show how the genes support these themes.

Feedback Loops and MicroRNA Regulatio n: 
• MYC expression is tightly regulated by feedback loops and microRNAs. PMP22 may alter 
the expression of specific microRNAs that target MYC, such as  let-7 or miR-34a, 
thereby affecting MYC levels . Experimental Validatio n 
 
To establish a causal relationship, you could:  
• Use Western blottin g or qPC R to measure MYC expression after PMP22 overexpression . • Apply  pharmacological inhibitor s or genetic tools (e.g., CRISPR) to block suspected 
signaling pat hways and observe changes in MYC expression . • Assess the role of ER stress markers (e.g., CHOP, BiP) to link PMP22 overexpression to 
UPR . By understanding these mechanisms, you might 
uncover novel insights into cellular stress, growth, and 
oncogenic tran sformation driven by PMP22 
overexpression.

However, while high-fat diet can partially compensate for a deﬁciency in fatty
acid synthesis in the CNS, in the PNS a high fat diet results in worsening of myelin defects when fatty
acid synthesis is impaired [ 110,111]. The mechanisms underlying di erential e ects in the CNS vs.
PNS remain to be determined. Taken together the current literature suggests that the uptake of fatty
acid may not be the primary pathway for myelin formation. However, the importance of fatty acid
uptake contributing to the energetic metabolism of myelinating cells and axonal trophic support is
still unclear. Finally, there is also new evidence that lipids could be provided to myelin cells by neurons. A recent study found that fatty acids are released by hyperactive neurons and can be taken up by
neighboring glia to protect neurons from fatty acid toxicity [158]. 11. Fatty Acid Oxidation
The nervous system has very high metabolic demands. Notably the CNS consumes 20% of
the body’s oxygen supply. While the metabolic requirements for neural activity have been well
characterized, the energetic requirement for myelin formation and maintenance, as well as the
mechanisms for energetic production in myelinating cells, are not well understood [ 159].

occurring for the same gene mutation (particularly for the 
CMT1A duplication), sometimes even within the same family; 
the slow disease progression in many CMT cases, which is 
good for the patients but makes it difficult to measure wor -
sening in natural history studies and assess benefit from 
tested treatments; and the rarity of the majority of CMT 
types, a challenge for studies on pathomechanisms and clin-
ical trials. Therefore, there is still a lot of work to do with 
preclinical and clinical studies before effective treatments 
become available for many CMT forms. From the preclinical standpoint, it is important to work on 
reliable animal models reproducing the disease as close as 
possible. There are many novel available models, particularly 
rodents, but flies and zebrafishes are also gaining popularity 
because they allow cheaper and more rapid studies with 
greater animal numbers; the use of patient-specific iPSCs to 
derive neural cells constitutes a major advance to understand 
pathogenic mechanisms of disease and to test potential ther -
apeutic compounds [61].
