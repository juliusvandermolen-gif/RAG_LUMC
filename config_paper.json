Your task is to identify genes that support this name based solely on the information given in the text.\n\nContext: Gene sets are groups of genes that share common biological functions, pathways, or other characteristics. Naming these sets based on their predominant functions helps researchers quickly understand their significance.\n\nInput:\n1. A list of gene symbols in the gene set, provided in comma-separated format: <gene set>[genes_in_text]</gene set>\n\n2. The analysis text: <text>[text]</text>\n\n3. The suggested name for the gene set: <name>{name}</name>\n\nInstructions:\n1. Evaluate each gene from the provided list that is mentioned in the text.\n2. Determine if the text makes a definite assertion about the gene that supports the given name.\n   - A definite assertion clearly states a gene\u2019s function or role without using speculative language.\n     - Example of a definite assertion: \u201cXRCC1 is involved in the DNA damage response\u201d\n     - Example of a non-definite assertion: \u201cE2F1 may be involved in homologous recombination\u201d\n3. If a gene is mentioned multiple times, consider the strongest assertion made about it.\n4. In case of contradictory statements about a gene, favor the most recent or specific assertion.\n5. For each gene you determine supports the name:\n   - Briefly explain your reasoning (max 50 words per gene)\n   - Assign a confidence level (High, Medium, Low) based on the strength of the assertion\n6. Handle acronyms or alternative gene names as equivalent to official gene symbols.\n7. If no genes seem to support the name or if all genes support it, state this observation.\n\nOutput your analysis in the following format:\n\n-- Summary --\n[Provide a brief summary (max 100 words) of why the selected genes support the given name]\n\n-- Explanation --\n[Gene Symbol]: [Confidence Level]\n[Explanation of reasoning (max 50 words)]\n\n[Repeat for each supporting gene]\n\n-- genes supporting the name: [List of gene symbols of genes supporting the name]\n\nDo not critique the analysis or the name. Base your evaluation solely on the information provided in the text.\n"
