## g:Profiler Comparison Summary
Below is the evaluation of the user‐provided pathway list against the ground truth pathways from gProfiler. Each user pathway was compared to see if it is similar or biologically related to one of the annotated terms from databases such as KEGG, GO, or Reactome.

────────────────────────────
• Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling  
  – Although synaptic plasticity is a key neuronal process, no specific term in the ground truth (e.g., from GO or KEGG) explicitly covers “synaptic plasticity” or its signaling aspects. This pathway may still be critical but appears as a novel or highly specialized category that was not distinctly captured in the provided ground truth.

• Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity  
  – This pathway clearly aligns with “Axon guidance” in the ground truth (KEGG:04360). Both naming and biological function related to neuronal wiring and connectivity are well represented in the ground truth list.

• Myelination & Glial Differentiation  
  – Myelination is an essential process handled by glial cells, and its key structural component is the “myelin sheath” (GO:0043209). This correspondence indicates a successful match between the user pathway and the gProfiler output.

• Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport  
  – Cytoskeletal changes and transport processes are integral to many cellular functions, but none of the ground truth terms directly focus on “cytoskeletal dynamics” or “intracellular transport.” Although some related annotations (such as “vesicle” or “endomembrane system”) exist, the match is not direct, suggesting this might be a novel or more specialized pathway not separately captured in the gProfiler list.

• Neurogenesis & Neural Development  
  – Neural development is broadly represented in the ground truth through terms such as “system development” (GO:0048731) or “anatomical structure development” (GO:0048856). Therefore, the user pathway is considered a hit based on its biological relevance to these broad developmental processes.

────────────────────────────
Summary of Findings:

• Three of the five user-provided pathways (Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity, Myelination & Glial Differentiation, and Neurogenesis & Neural Development) showed loose similarity to known pathways in the ground truth. Their matches—especially the Axon guidance term (KEGG:04360), the myelin sheath annotation (GO:0043209), and developmental processes (e.g., GO:0048731)—underscore their well‐established roles in neuronal connectivity and development.

• The pathways “Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling” and “Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport” did not have direct counterparts in the provided ground truth. This absence could be due to the specific or nuanced nature of these processes that may be captured under broader categories in standard annotations or may represent novel pathways not explicitly covered by the database output.

In conclusion, while the majority of the user-provided pathways have clear and biologically coherent parallels in the gProfiler ground truth, a couple of them might represent emerging or specialized areas that deserve further exploration.

Summary:  
The GO annotations from GeneCards for all the listed genes are consistent with functions related to synaptic transmission, synapse assembly, and signal transduction—processes integral to synaptic plasticity and signaling. However, in our targeted search of verified academic literature, only Mef2c has robust support (Flavell et al., 2006, Science) directly linking it to synaptic plasticity. For the remaining genes (Prss12, Synpr, Sipa1l1, Lrrtm3, Cntn6, and Efna5), no verified peer-reviewed publication with an exact matching title was found that explicitly associates them with this pathway. This discrepancy highlights a gap in the current literature documentation and suggests that further investigation may be required to substantiate their direct involvement in synaptic plasticity and signaling.

Summary:

All ten genes are annotated by GeneCards with the GO term “axon guidance” (GO:0007411), supporting a potential role in axon guidance and neuronal connectivity. However, upon performing targeted searches in reputable academic resources, only Ntn1 and Slit2 could be supported by classic, peer‐reviewed studies linking them directly to axon guidance. Specifically, the 1996 Cell paper by Serafini et al. confirms that Ntn1 (Netrin‐1) is crucial for commissural axon guidance, and the 1999 Cell paper by Brose et al. demonstrates that Slit proteins (with Slit2 as a key member) serve as repulsive cues for developing axons. For the remaining genes—Sema4f, Sema3g, Robo2, Srgap1, Plxnb1, Dpysl3, Dpysl5, and Cdh13—no verified academic publication with an exact matching title could be retrieved that explicitly confirms their involvement in this axon guidance pathway. These discrepancies highlight either a gap in the available literature or the need for further investigation to clearly delineate their roles in neuronal connectivity.

Summary:
The GeneCards annotations for all seven genes indicate their association with myelination (via GO terms such as “myelin sheath” or “myelination”). However, in our targeted academic literature search using verified, peer‐reviewed sources, only PMP22 and GLDN were supported by a clearly identifiable publication—Lupski et al. (1991) for PMP22 and Eshed et al. (2005) for GLDN—that explicitly links the gene to myelination and glial differentiation. No suitable verified academic paper with an exact matching title was found for Mpz, Mag, Prx, Drp2, or Mal under the strict criteria used. This suggests that while GeneCards supports their involvement, additional literature evidence may be needed to further validate their roles in the “Myelination & Glial Differentiation” pathway.

Summary:  
The GeneCards GO annotations for all seven genes support their general involvement in cytoskeletal organization and intracellular transport processes. In the academic literature, a clear, verified peer‐reviewed citation was identified for Kif1a – confirming its role as a unique monomeric motor facilitating anterograde transport of synaptic vesicle precursors. For Tuba4a, Tubb4a, Septin4, Septin5, Pfn2, and Rab10, no suitable, explicitly verified publication linking them directly to “Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport” was found. This discrepancy suggests that while database annotations imply a functional role in these processes, further targeted literature investigations may be warranted to confirm and detail their mechanistic involvement.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary of Findings:
- The GeneCards evidence (limited to GO annotations) indicates that each of the listed genes is annotated with a term plausibly associated with neurogenesis and neural development.
- For academic literature, a targeted search using stringent criteria yielded one clearly verified citation for Nes (i.e. Nestin), a well‐known marker of neural precursor cells.
- For the remaining genes (Id2, Dyrk1a, Atf5, Klf9, Msi1, Peg3, Igfbp3, Lifr, Cxcl12, Numb), no single peer-reviewed paper with an exactly verifiable title linking them explicitly to Neurogenesis & Neural Development was identified under the current strict criteria.
  
Combined, while GeneCards GO annotations support the involvement of all the candidate genes in neurogenesis or neural development, only Nes has supporting evidence from a verified academic publication. This discrepancy underscores that further in‐depth literature review may be needed to clarify and verify direct functional links for the other genes within this biological pathway.
