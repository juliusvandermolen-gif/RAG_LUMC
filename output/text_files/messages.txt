matory and immune-related pathways in several cell types, includ -
ing NF-к B signalling in excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons and 
OPCs; T cell receptor and cytokine signalling in astrocytes; and 
tumour-necrosis-factor-mediated signalling in microglia and excitatory 
neurons (Fig. 1a). We also observed downregulation of synaptic-related 
processes, including ion channel activity, excitatory postsynaptic poten -
tial and synaptic plasticity (Fig. 1a). Notably, these alterations not only 
occurred in neurons (for example, voltage-gated calcium channel activ -
ity), but also in oligodendrocytes (for example, long-term neuronal 
synaptic plasticity). In APOE4 excitatory neurons, we identified upregu -
lation of ERK1/2 signalling (such as MAPK1 , MAP2K1  and MAP2K2 ) and 
endosomal-related transport (such as RAB21  and SNX12) genes (Sup -
plementary Table 4). All of these effects are consistent with the reported 
roles of APOE4 in inflammation, synaptic impairment, MAPK1 signalling 
and downstream APP transcription and early endosomes7,18.

Thus, by analogy with epithelial cell polar -
ity, the abaxonal membrane of myelinated fibers is defined as a basolateral-like region, whereas the adaxonal membrane, SLI, paranodes and microvilli are considered apical-like regions [18, 19]. Schwann Cell Development
During early vertebrate development, neural crest cells delaminate from the neural tube, proliferate, and migrate to generate a broad spectrum of cell types including, among others, Schwann cells, melanocytes, sympathetic neurons, sensory neurons, and skeletal and connective tissues of the head [24– 26]. The cell fate largely depends from the region 
of origin of the neural tube from which neural crest cells migrate. These regions are defined in an anterior–posterior axis direction as cranial, cardiac, vagal, trunk, and sacral. In particular, Schwann cells, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons, sympathetic neurons, and satellite cells associated with sensory neurons, all originate from ventrally migrating trunk neural crest cells [27].

Perinatally, in rodents, SCs radially sort and subsequently myelinate 
individual axons larger than 1 μm in diameter, while small calibre axons become organised in non-myelinating 
Remak bundles. SCs have a vital role in maintaining axonal health throughout life and several specialized SC 
types perform essential functions at specific locations, such as terminal SC at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) 
or SC within cutaneous sensory end organs. In addition, neural crest derived satellite glia maintain a tight 
communication with the soma of sensory, sympathetic, and parasympathetic neurons and neural crest de-
rivatives are furthermore an indispensable part of the enteric nervous system. The remarkable plasticity of SCs 
becomes evident in the context of a nerve injury, where SC transdifferentiate into intriguing repair cells, which 
orchestrate a regenerative response that promotes nerve repair. Indeed, the multiple adaptations of SCs are 
captivating, but remain often ill-resolved on the molecular level.

In amphibians, GPCR activation 
in perisynaptic SC has a negative impact on synaptic transmitter release, 
whereas GPCR inhibition prevented this synaptic depression (Robitaille, 
1998 ). On the other hand, Ca2chelation in perisynaptic SC has been 
shown to dissolve synaptic potentiation (Castonguay and Robitaille, 
2001 ), demonstrating that “perisynaptic SC” can both decrease and in-
crease synaptic activity. The type of modulation has been shown to be 
influenced by the pattern of synaptic firing resulting in distinct “peri-
synaptic SC” calcium kinetics and an ATP release from perisynaptic SC 
(Todd et al., 2010 ). In addition, perisynaptic SC may also release a 
number of other neuromodulatory molecules, including glutamate, ni-
tric oxide and prostaglandines (Ko and Robitaille, 2015 ). After nerve injury, perisynaptic SC emanate long sprouts that can 
form bridges between neighbouring NMJs (Son and Thompson, 1995 ). Upon reinnervation, axons can pass these bridges and innervate adjacent 
endplates (Kang et al., 2003 ; Love and Thompson, 1999 ; Reynolds and 
Woolf, 1993 ; Son and Thompson, 1995 ).

Schwann cells then undergo to a developmental process 
including two main intermediate stages: Schwann cell pre-cursors (SCPs) and immature Schwann cells (iSCs). SCPs are found among the axons of developing nerves from which they strictly depend for survival and proliferation. At this stage, at E (embryonic stage)12–13 in the mouse and E14–15 in the rat, SCPs and developing axons are not surrounded by connective tissue and do not have blood structures to supply them [24– 26]. Surprisingly, SCPs do not influence axons to 
growth and to reach the target [28, 29]. In mouse mutants 
lacking SCPs, axons grow normally but are defasciculated at the nerve terminal with altered branching and sprouting [29]. On the contrary, at later stages, DRG sensory neu-
rons and motor neurons die, suggesting that glial cells are crucial to provide trophic support to axons [25]. Similarly to neural crest cells, SCPs maintain an extraordinary multi-potency and plasticity as they can generate melanocytes, sensory neurons, parasympathetic neurons, and fibroblasts, which will constitute the “mature” endoneurium [25, 30].

Abstract
Myelin is a key evolutionary specialization and adaptation of vertebrates formed by the plasma membrane of glial cells, which insulate axons in the nervous system. Myelination not only allows rapid and efficient transmission of electric impulses in the axon by decreasing capacitance and increasing resistance but also influences axonal metabolism and the plasticity of neural circuits. In this review, we will focus on Schwann cells, the glial cells which form myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we will describe the main extrinsic and intrinsic signals inducing Schwann cell differentiation and myelination and how myelin biogenesis is achieved. Finally, we will also discuss how the study of human disorders in which molecules and pathways relevant for myelination are altered has enormously contributed to the current knowledge on myelin biology.

In the outbred rat model of CMT1A,22rats can have varying 
levels of rodent Pmp22 expression, giving rise to a spectrum of pheno -
type severities, including variations in the expression of lipid 
metabolism-related genes.22,49To understand how these transcrip -
tional changes influence the CMT1A lipid profiles, we performed lipi-
domics on the sciatic nerves of 5-week-old C3 mice. Overall, the 
analysis revealed a major downregulation of lipid species in general, 
particularly of SPs, with SMs being the most affected in the sciatic 
nerves of C3 mice compared with their age-matched littermate con-
trols. In further support of these alterations, CMT1A rat sciatic nerve 
myelin exhibited significantly reduced levels of total cholesterol, PC, 
PE, plasmalogens, SM and ceramides.49
The correct PM lipid composition is essential for Schwann cells to 
interact with axons and to produce myelin, the multilamellar lipid- 
based structure. During Schwann cell lineage development, neural 
crest cells give rise to SCPs, which are guided to the most distal regions 
of the body by the extending peripheral axons.51Once interacting with 
axons, SCPs can differentiate into immature Schwann cells, which or-
ganize axons to be myelinated and non-myelinated in a process de-
fined as radial sorting.52To investigate the cellular origins of CMT1A 
lipid alterations, we developed a protocol to derive a Schwann cell lin-
eage from iPSCs.

Next, we asked whether the disease biomarkers identified in 
the C22 transcriptomic study can be confirmed in the CMT1A rat 
model. Consistent with findings in C22 mice, the mRNA levels of lipid biosynthetic genes such as Sc5d and Ugt8a were decreased in CMT1A rats, although to a lesser extent than in C22 mouse nerves. ASO6 treatment trended toward increased mRNA levels of these genes (Figure 3G). Furthermore, the mRNA levels of Id2  
and Bzw2  were significantly increased in CMT1A rats compared 
with WT rats and were substantially decreased following ASO6 treatment (Figure 3G). Finally, we sought to identify a target engagement biomarker 
in the CMT1A rats. Toward this end, we collected blood and foot -
pad skin biopsies from treated CMT1A rats. Although there was detectable rat Pmp22 mRNA in the blood, there was no change in Pmp22 levels following ASO6 treatment (Supplemental Fig -
ure 5E). The level of rat Pmp22 mRNA in the footpad (containing dermal nerves and Schwann cells) was significantly reduced in ASO6- compared with control-treated rats, suggesting this could serve as a biomarker of target engagement (Figure 3H).

Astro -
cytes are also known to influence oligodendrocyte development by 
modulating the availability of growth factors and nutrients required for 
oligodendrocyte differentiation [4]. Astrocyte activation in response to 
CNS injury can have both protective and detrimental effects on overall 
neuronal survival and myelination [5]. In this study, we aimed to study 
the effect of hypoxia on astrocytes to delineate the pathways that could 
potentially impact oligodendrocyte maturation. Transcriptomic analysis of human fetal neural stem cell-derived as-
trocytes subjected to hypoxia demonstrated the upregulation of 
cholesterol biosynthetic pathways. These findings were validated by 
measuring the gene and protein expression of cholesterol synthetic and 
transport proteins in FNSC-derived astrocytes and in a cell line model. Astrocyte cholesterol content and efflux was also increased in response 
to hypoxia. However, premyelinating oligodendrocytes did not

Furthermore, neural crest derived cells give rise to satellite glia cells

originate from neural crest cells and are important constituents of the

satellite and enteric glial cells. For the role of SCs in the CNS, as well as 
for olfactory ensheathing cells, we refer the reader to respective reviews

Terminal SCs are specialized non-myelinating SCs that are tightly 
engaged either as perisynaptic SCs at the NMJ, or as terminal SCs around 
cutaneous sensory end organs.

there were small bspeckles Qof NDRG1 immunoreactivity in
Schwann cells and scattered small blobs of MAG immunoreactiv-ity in macrophages ( Fig. 8 C). These data show that the expression
of NDRG1, like that of other myelin-related proteins, decreases
after permanent axotomy and that macrophages contribute to thephagocytosis of myelin-related proteins ( Scherer and Salzer, 2001 ).

Hypoxic injury to the preterm brain leads to death of vulnerable 
premyelinating oligodendrocytes which are the most abundant oligo -
dendroglial lineage cells in the brain at 27–32 weeks of gestation [10]. Hypoxic injury to premyelinating oligodendrocytes leads to failure of 
maturation and myelination [11]. Astrocytes influence oligodendroglial 
development through the secretion of growth factors and providing 
metabolic support in both physiological and pathological states [12]. In 
this study, the mechanisms by which altered astrocyte function in 
hypoxic conditions could impact oligodendrocyte development were 
investigated. A model of primary human astrocytes differentiated from 
fetal neural stem cells and characterised for the expression of astrocyte- 
specific proteins [6] was used.

In both cases, a single, continuous basal lamina covers 
these neuron-satellite glia units, which are separated from each other by 
connective tissue (Pannese, 2010 ). During development, SGCs are 
derived from neural crest cells and likely furthermore originate from 
boundary cap cells (Jessen and Mirsky, 2005 ; Marol et al., 2004 ). As 
SGCs share several similarities with SC precursor cells, they have been 
suggested to represent a population of developmentally arrested SCs 
(George et al., 2018 ). Though, other studies demonstrate a molecular 
profile more reminiscent to astrocytes (Avraham et al., 2020 ; Jager 
et al., 2020 ; van Weperen et al., 2021 ) and emphasize overlapping 
functions to astrocytes in the CNS (Hanani and Spray, 2020 ; Huang 
et al., 2013 ). However, satellite glial cells were shown to also express 
unique genes that are absent in SCs and astrocytes (Mapps et al., 2022 ). Recent RNA-sequencing studies identified a pronounced M. Bosch-Queralt et al. Neurobiology of Disease 176 (2023) 105952
11heterogeneity of SGCs and identified different SGCs types depending on 
their association with either sensory or sympathetic ganglia (Avraham 
et al., 2021 ; Mapps et al., 2022 ; Tasdemir-Yilmaz et al., 2021 ; van 
Weperen et al., 2021 ).

Here, phago -
cytosing perisynaptic SCs contribute to the elimination of all but one 
axon terminals from polyneuronally innervated NMJs, which typically 
occur during mammalian neonatal development (Brill et al., 2011 ; Lee 
et al., 2016 ; Smith et al., 2013 ). Individual perisynaptic SCs are thereby 
able to sense the activity of the competing axons (Darabid et al., 2013 ) 
but it is still unclear whether they also contribute to the decision of 
which of the axons ultimately prevail in long term synapse formation. Next to providing trophic support toward the NMJ and their role in 
guidance of axonal (re-) innervation and synaptogenesis, perisynaptic 
SCs also detect and modulate neuromuscular transmission itself (Ko and 
Robitaille, 2015 ). The ability to sense and decode synaptic activity is not 
restricted to development, but is also a feature of adult perisynaptic SC 
which is realized by intracellular Ca2signalling downstream of G- 
protein coupled (Jahromi et al., 1999 ; Reist and Smith, 1992 ), musca -
rinic (M1, M3 or M5; Wright et al., 2009 ) and purinergic (adenosine A1; 
Rochon et al., 2001 ) receptors (GPCRs).

However, cholesterol biosynthesis gene expression in APOE3/3 
individuals displayed a bimodal trend, with higher expression in AD 
(Fig. 2a), suggesting potential modulation of cholesterol pathways by 
AD pathology. To test whether the effects of APOE4 were independent of 
the effects of AD, we performed pathology-stratified analyses focusing 
on lipid-associated pathways. Cholesterol biosynthesis gene expres-
sion increased in individuals without AD pathology (Extended Data 
Fig. 2e,f; lipid-storage pathways were also increased) and there was a 
non-significant increase in individuals with AD (Extended Data Fig. 2g), 
indicating an APOE4 effect independent of AD pathology. Individuals 
with AD versus control individuals also exhibited similar increases when 
controlling for APOE3/3 and APOE3/4 backgrounds, suggesting an effect

However, when co- 
migrating SC precursors in peripheral nerves are experimentally abla-
ted during embryonic development, both sensory and motor neurons are 
initially formed in sufficient numbers, and their axons group into a 
nerve, navigate for considerable distances and form initial synapses at 
their targets (Morris et al., 1999 ; Riethmacher et al., 1997 ; Woldeyesus 
et al., 1999 ). This was reported in mice and zebrafish with loss of SC at 
the precursor stage after genetic inactivation of Neuregulin1 (NRG1)- 
ERBB receptor signalling (Lyons et al., 2005 ; Morris et al., 1999 ; Raphael 
and Talbot, 2011 ; Riethmacher et al., 1997 ; Woldeyesus et al., 1999 ) as 
well as in the splotch mouse mutant (Grim et al., 1992 ). Nevertheless, 
aberrant projections and distal axonal defasciculation, leading to inac-
curate location of synaptic sides and impaired target innervation char-
acterizes Erbb mutants (Morris et al., 1999 ). In addition, SC precursors 
form complex scaffolds around the growth cone, which keep remarkably 
consistent contacts with axonal membranes (Wanner et al., 2006 ), and 
facilitate correct target innervation by regulating nerve fasciculation at 
the growing nerve endings (Grossmann et al., 2009 ; Morris et al., 1999 ;

Niacin/Niaspan has been shown to reduce hypermyelination in the vimentin-
null model and is related to improved Nrg1 type III expression. Additionally, Niaspan
was reported to reduce myelin out folding in the nerves of Mtmr2 / mice, a model of
CMT4B1 neuropathy, and diminish tomacula in the nerves of Pmp22 +/ mice, a model
of HNPP neuropathy [ 31]. In a mouse model of demyelinating CMT1B, the neurophysi-
ological and morphological parameters were promoted by the genetic overexpression of
Nrg1-III without aggravating the toxic gain-of-function underlying the neuropathy. More-
over, stimulation of Nrg1-III signaling through pharmacological repression of the Nrg1-III
inhibitor TACE enhanced neuropathy [ 30]. Ameliorated PI3K-Akt signaling by axonally
overexpressed Nrg1 leads to contaminated SCs to differentiate and conserves peripheral
nerve axons. Notably, in a preclinical treatment trial using a CMT1A rat model, soluble
NRG1 successfully overcame impaired peripheral nerve development and restored axon
survival into adulthood when treatment was limited to early postnatal development [ 32].

good for the patients but makes it difficult to measure wor -
sening in natural history studies and assess benefit from 
tested treatments; and the rarity of the majority of CMT 
types, a challenge for studies on pathomechanisms and clin-
ical trials. Therefore, there is still a lot of work to do with 
preclinical and clinical studies before effective treatments 
become available for many CMT forms. From the preclinical standpoint, it is important to work on 
reliable animal models reproducing the disease as close as 
possible. There are many novel available models, particularly 
rodents, but flies and zebrafishes are also gaining popularity 
because they allow cheaper and more rapid studies with 
greater animal numbers; the use of patient-specific iPSCs to 
derive neural cells constitutes a major advance to understand 
pathogenic mechanisms of disease and to test potential ther -
apeutic compounds [61].

The
results of this study propose that the pharmacological suppression of the P2X7 receptor is
tolerable in CMT1A rats, thus offering an evidence-based suggestion that inhibiting this
pathway could rectify the molecular abnormalities and enhance the clinical presentation
of CMT1A neuropathy [ 28]. The transition to clinical experiments for CMT1A is made
smoother by prior Phase II clinical trials involving rheumatoid arthritis, where a P2X7
antagonist demonstrated satisfactory safety and tolerability [29]. 3.1.6. Lipid Supplementation
In a rat model of CMT1A, myelinating SCs display a developmental deﬁciency char-
acterized by lessened genes transcription necessary for myelin lipid biosynthesis. The
supplementation of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in the diet of rats
enhanced biosynthesis of myelin and nerve function. While clinical experiments have
shown no disadvantages from this therapy, it is still uncertain if high amounts of dietary
phospholipids can help CMT1A patients [ 21].

Schwann cells express Sox10 at all stages of development 
as early as in migratory neural crest cells before lineage specification, thus suggesting that Sox10 is a key determi-nant of Schwann cell identity [41, 42]. Sox10 is also crucial 
in terminal differentiation and in myelin maintenance, as it controls the expression of several myelin genes encoding P0, MBP, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and Cx32 [33]. Conditional deletion in adult nerves showed that Sox10 
is also required for myelin homeostasis to maintain myelin integrity [43]. In mutant mice lacking Oct6, myelin genes are repressed 
and myelination is blocked [44, 45]. A double Oct6/Brn2  
KO model shows a more severe phenotype as compared to single Oct6 KO, thus suggesting that these factors cooperate 
to promote the transition to a myelinating phenotype. Even if more severe than the single KO, in Oct6/Brn2, double KO myelination is delayed but not completely blocked [46]. This finding led to the hypothesis that another factor such as Brn1 can in part compensate loss of Oct6 in vivo [47].

Approximately 30 diseases are related to the differentially expressed 
protein groups of the neuropathic nerves. These diseases range be-
tween the groupings of endocrine and nutritional, congenital and 
chromosomal abnormalities, and nervous system diseases (Figure  8a). We chose to focus on nervous system disorders due to their rele-
vance to the current study. Neurological diseases identified include 
illnesses of the myoneural junction and muscle, systemic atrophies of 
the CNS, episodic and paroxysmal disorders, and polyneuropathies of the PNS (Figure  8b). Figure  8c depicts the top six neural disorders 
(A- F), which share overlapping protein perturbations with the neuro-
pathic nerves, and the specific proteins corresponding to the disease 
are represented in the chord diagram. As expected, CMT is the most 
enriched nervous system disease, while there are parallels with other 
illnesses as well. For example, TrJ mouse nerves display abnormal ac-
cumulation of cellular products in the cytoplasm (Fortun et al., 2003; 
Zhou et al., 2020), similar to neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, which 
represents a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by 
undegraded lysosomal cargo (Nita et al., 2016).

It is also reasonable that modulating Nrg1-III 
activity may constitute a general therapeutic strategy to treat 
CMT that are characterized by de/dysmyelination. Recently 
genetic overexpression of Nrg1-III has been shown to ameliorate 
the neurophysiological and morphological parameters in 
a mouse model of CMT1B and stimulating Nrg1-III signaling by 
pharmacological suppression of the Nrg1-III inhibitor TACE also 
ameliorated the neuropathy [46]. The importance of the neur -
egulin pathway is confirmed by the notable finding that soluble 
Neuregulin1 type I promoted myelin repair after nerve injury 
and its administration to CMT1A rats improved their motor 
performance, increased the number of myelinated axons in 
sciatic nerves, and restored the reduced axonal caliber [47]. 2.8. CMT4B: other approaches
CMT4B1 and CMT4B2 are caused by loss-of-function mutations 
in the myotubularin-related 2 (MTMR2, CMT4B1) and MTMR13 
(also known as SBF2, SET binding factor 2, CMT4B2) genes, 
involved in the phosphoinositides (PIs) metabolism [48].

However, while high-fat diet can partially compensate for a deﬁciency in fatty
acid synthesis in the CNS, in the PNS a high fat diet results in worsening of myelin defects when fatty
acid synthesis is impaired [ 110,111]. The mechanisms underlying di erential e ects in the CNS vs.
PNS remain to be determined. Taken together the current literature suggests that the uptake of fatty
acid may not be the primary pathway for myelin formation. However, the importance of fatty acid
uptake contributing to the energetic metabolism of myelinating cells and axonal trophic support is
still unclear. Finally, there is also new evidence that lipids could be provided to myelin cells by neurons. A recent study found that fatty acids are released by hyperactive neurons and can be taken up by
neighboring glia to protect neurons from fatty acid toxicity [158]. 11. Fatty Acid Oxidation
The nervous system has very high metabolic demands. Notably the CNS consumes 20% of
the body’s oxygen supply. While the metabolic requirements for neural activity have been well
characterized, the energetic requirement for myelin formation and maintenance, as well as the
mechanisms for energetic production in myelinating cells, are not well understood [ 159].

We identify a number of strategies to reduce pTau in a
CE-dependent manner and ﬁnd that allosteric activation ofCYP46A1 is a neuron-speciﬁc CE-lowering strategy particularly
well tolerated by human astrocytes. Collectively, our data identify
a CYP46A1-CE-Tau axis as an early druggable pathway in AD. RESULTS
A Drug Screen in iPSC-Derived Human FAD Neurons to
Identify Compounds that Reduce pTau Accumulation
pThr231Tau is an early marker of AD pathology that correlateswell with cognitive decline ( Buerger et al., 2002; Luna-Mun ˜oz
et al., 2007 ). pThr231Tau accumulates in APP duplication
(APP
dp) iPSC-derived FAD neurons ( Israel et al., 2012 ). To iden-tify compounds that reduce pTau accumulation in these FAD
neurons, we screened a collection of 1,684 approved and
preclinical drugs for their efﬁcacy to lower neuronal pThr231Tau. For our screen, neural progenitor cells (NPCs; line APPdp1-6)
(Israel et al., 2012 ) were differentiated to neurons ( Figures S1 A
and S1B) for 3 weeks, replated in 384 well plates, and allowed
to mature for 2 weeks before treatment with compound at5mM for 5 days.

[25]. mRNA expression of both lipid catabolizing and anabolizing transcripts were affected. This study further
showed that during development, lipid metabolism genes (including those of sterol metabolism) failed to
up-regulate in a CMT1A background compared with WT, suggesting a failure to engage lipid synthesis during
myelination. Lipidomics studies conducted on CMT1A rats and human serum samples [ 26] found that rat sciatic nerves
exhibited impaired sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism in which ceramides, sphingomyelins,
hexosylceramides, and sphingosine were all reduced in CMT1A samples [ 26]. An earlier study also found these
same lipid species to be reduced in CMT1A rat sciatic nerve myelin and also cholesterol, PC, and PG lipid
species [ 25,26]. The two studies tested regimens of lipid supplementation (by either adding lipids or various
components of different lipid biosynthetic pathways) and observed improvements in myelination. A transcriptomic analysis of C3 (CMT1A model) mice found that the most severely down-regulated genes
were those involved in cholesterol biosynthesis [ 27].
