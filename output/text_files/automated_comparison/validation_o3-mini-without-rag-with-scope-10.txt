Narrative Summary:

Each of the pathways you provided could be associated with an underlying biological process represented in the ground truth. For example, “Axon Guidance and Neuronal Migration Pathway” aligns with the “Axon guidance” pathway, while synaptic communication is captured by the “Activation of NMDA receptors and postsynaptic events” hit. Notch signaling—a well‐known regulator of neural progenitor maintenance and neurogenesis—is the closest match for your third entry, and “Myelination Signaling Pathway” covers the myelination aspect along with neural structural integrity. Although the ground truth lists only a non‐canonical (beta‐catenin independent) version of Wnt signaling, this was chosen as the closest match for the neural patterning component. In addition, the combined neuronal adhesion and extracellular matrix process is well represented by “Extracellular matrix organization,” and for growth factor/neurotrophic signaling, “NGF processing” is the matching process. 

None of the pathways appear to be novel; all are established/common neuronal processes as reflected in the ground truth list.
