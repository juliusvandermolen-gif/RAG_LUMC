## g:Profiler Comparison Summary
Here is a comparison of your five user‐defined pathways against the ground‐truth terms from gProfiler. All five map to at least one biologically related annotation, so none appear fully novel under these loose criteria.

Summary  
- Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling maps to GO:0010646 (“regulation of cell communication”), reflecting the modulation of synaptic signaling even though “plasticity” per se isn’t listed.  
- Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity directly matches KEGG:04360, a core neurodevelopmental pathway.  
- Myelination & Glial Differentiation is captured by GO:0043209, indicating formation of the myelin sheath.  
- Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport aligns with GO:0051128, covering rearrangements of cellular structures (including vesicle/organelle movements).  
- Neurogenesis & Neural Development corresponds to GO:0048731 (“system development”), reflecting broad organ‐system maturation encompassing the nervous system.  

No GPT pathway failed to find a related annotation—each is represented in the ground truth, though some only by broader parent terms rather than highly specific synaptic or glial differentiation entries.

Summary:  
- GeneCards GO annotations for all seven genes indicate molecular functions or localizations consistent with neural processes (proteolysis, vesicle trafficking, dendritic morphogenesis, transcriptional regulation, synapse organization, cell adhesion, signal transduction).  
- However, targeted searches in PubMed and Google Scholar did not yield peer-reviewed publications explicitly linking any of these genes by name to “Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling.”  
- Thus, while bioinformatics annotations suggest potential relevance, direct experimental evidence or focused literature describing their roles in this pathway remains to be documented.

Summary:
- GeneCards GO annotations support the assignment of Sema4f, Sema3g, Ntn1, Robo2, Slit2, Srgap1, Plxnb1, Dpysl3, and Dpysl5 to axon guidance processes, and Cdh13 to cell adhesion relevant to neuronal connectivity.
- Targeted searches in PubMed and Google Scholar did not yield directly quotable, peer-reviewed publications linking these specific genes to “Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity” under the strict requirements (exact title and quotation) of this validation protocol.
- While GO annotations suggest functional roles, the absence of immediately verifiable quotes highlights a gap that may require deeper or broader literature review, or access to full-text sources for precise citation.

Summary:
- All seven genes carry Gene Ontology annotations directly related to myelin structure or myelin assembly, supporting their proposed roles in myelination and glial differentiation.
- Peer-reviewed support was identified for PMP22 (Lupski et al. 1992) and GLDN (Eshed et al. 2005), linking gene dosage or protein function to peripheral myelination.
- No explicit, verified academic-paper citations were found under our strict search criteria for MPZ, MAG, PRX, DRP2, or MAL, indicating a gap in easily accessible, singular studies that describe their roles in this pathway with the exact phrasing required. Further targeted literature review may uncover additional direct evidence.

Summary:
- All seven genes show Gene Ontology annotations from GeneCards consistent with roles in microtubule/actin cytoskeletal processes or vesicle-mediated transport.
- No peer-reviewed publication was identified that explicitly links any of these genes by name to the composite pathway term "Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport."
- Thus, while GO annotations support their individual involvement in relevant molecular functions and processes, direct literature evidence for the combined pathway label remains lacking.

Summary:
- All eleven genes are annotated in GeneCards with GO terms directly related to neurogenesis or neural development, supporting their putative roles in this pathway.
- No peer-reviewed publications were identified that specifically and verifiably link each gene to the “Neurogenesis & Neural Development” pathway under the strict criteria (exact title matching) required. This highlights a gap between functional ontology annotations and directly cited experimental evidence for some of these genes in this context.
