Summary of Findings:

The evaluation shows that two of the user‐provided pathways align well with the established ground truth. “Axon Guidance and Neuronal Migration” closely matches the “Axon guidance” pathway (KEGG:04360), a well‐characterized route critical for directing neuronal growth and connectivity. Similarly, “Neural Cell Adhesion and Extracellular Matrix Organization” aligns with the “Extracellular matrix organization” pathway (REAC:R-RNO-1474244), which underlies the structural framework and intercellular interactions essential for neural tissue integrity.

On the other hand, “Synaptic Signaling and Plasticity” and “Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Axonal Transport” were not detected in the ground truth set. These may represent more specialized or emerging themes that are either not yet extensively curated or could be too specific relative to the broader categories captured by current databases.

Overall, the validated pathways demonstrate clear biological relevance and coherence in neural development and function, while the non-matched pathways highlight areas that might require deeper investigation to determine their precise role and representation in well‐established pathway databases.
