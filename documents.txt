S2g –i). However, we did ﬁnd that the total
mitochondrial acetyl-carnitine level was >4 times higher in MYC
HME cells compared to TERT HME cells (Supplementary Fig. S2j –l),
suggesting a much higher rate of acetyl-carnitine production inMYC HME cells. In addition, we detected ef ﬂux of acetyl-carnitine
into the medium from MYC and T58A HME cells, but not TERT and
HER2 HME cells, further evidence of highly active FAO in MYC HMEcells (Supplementary Fig. S2m). Overall, these results suggest that

●Compounds preventing axonal degeneration or rescuing altered axo-
nal transport have the potentiality to cure many hereditary neuro -
pathies irrespective of the primary triggering defect: this is the case 
for the inhibitors of SARM1 and of HDAC6, an active field of research. ●Intervention on more specific metabolic pathways is also promising, 
such as for L-Serine to treat HSN1 by reducing neurotoxic deoxy -
sphingolipids, or compounds acting on the PYKfive enzyme in the 
phosphoinositides metabolism in CMT4B, or S-adenosylmethionine 
(SAM) to supply purine nucleotides in CMTX5 and its allelic disorders. ●Mutations in sorbitol dehydrogenase has been very recently asso -
ciated with a relatively common form of CMT2/dHMN and high levels 
of sorbitol. Inhibitors of aldose reductase, developed in the past for 
diabetic neuropathy, are good candidates for its treatment. Table 1. List of CMT genes associated with the different types of CMT and related neuropathies. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and related neuropathies

DEFILIPPI  et al. mechanisms (Khoo et al., 2020; Klingler et al., 2021). Recognizing per-
turbations in subcellular cytoskeletal networks in CMT1E neuropathic 
nerves is an additional novel finding, likely a reflection of abnormal my-
elination and altered axo- glial communications (Robertson et al., 1997). Furthermore, the protein abnormalities in CMT1E mouse nerves re-
late highly with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou 
Gehrig's disease, which is considered a disorder of CNS motor neurons 
and does involve proteostatic imbalance (Cicardi et al., 2021). CMT 
and ALS have been investigated for overlapping pathophysiologies, in-
cluding comparison of nerve degeneration by ultrasound (Hildebrand 
et al., 2023). While the TrJ mouse is used to study CMT1E neuropa-
thy, these results suggest that this spontaneous animal model could be 
valuable for investigating various therapeutic targets.Group Gene log2FC Pval

Mutations in the GJB1 gene, encoding Cx32, localized at 
the gap junctions in  non-compact myelin, cause X-linked dominant demyelinating CMT1X. Other CMT forms are caused by mutations in genes 
encoding signaling proteins and proteins regulating endo-somal trafficking such as for instance MTMR2, MTMR13, and MTMR5 phospholipid phosphatase proteins mutated in autosomal recessive CMT4B1, B2, and B3, respectively, characterized by childhood onset and myelin outfoldings in the nerve.

Transcriptional analysis of CMT1A patient iPSC-SCPs showed a 
downregulation of several genes related to Schwann cell myelin -
ation and development. In addition, key lipid metabolism genes 
were downregulated, including the cholesterol efflux transporters 
ATP binding cassette subfamily A 1 (ABCA1) and ABCA3. PMP22 is 
known to regulate ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux, because 
Pmp22 knockout drastically upregulated ABCA1 and led to LD accu -
mulations in the peripheral nerves.17In addition, Zhou et al.55
showed cholesterol sequestration to lysosomes and reduced 
ATP-binding cassette transporter-dependent cholesterol efflux in 
CMT1A patient fibroblasts. In CMT1A iPSC-SCPs, we showed that 
several genes relating to lipid homeostasis and storage were down -
regulated. Interestingly, the autophagy-associated genes LAMP1 and 
LAMP2 were dysregulated, whereas NPC1 and NPC2 were downregu -
lated. NPC1 and NPC2 are intracellular transporters that act in tan-
dem to remove cholesterol from the lysosomal compartment37,39,56
and regulate cholesterol homeostasis through the generation of 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-derived oxysterols.56Loss of 
function of NPC1 or NPC2 proteins is known to cause the lysosomal 
storage disease Niemann–Pick disease, type C1 and 2, respectively.37
GO enrichment analysis revealed dysregulation in genes regu -
lating PM components, transmembrane signalling receptor activity 
and biological adhesion, all of which are essential factors regulating 
axo-glial interactions and myelination maintenance.57,58Lipidomic analysis showed significant alterations in SP in CMT1A 
iPSC-SCPs.

et al. described the frequency, detection rate, and mutation types in 14 representative
genes ( PMP22 ,GJB1 ,MPZ ,MFN2 ,SH3TC2 ,GDAP1 ,NEFL ,LITAF ,GARS ,HSPB1 ,FIG4 ,
EGR2 ,PRX , and RAB7A ) related to CMT in a cohort study of 17,880 patients tested in a
commercial genetic laboratory. Genetic anomalies were detected in 18.5% (n = 3312) of the
total population. Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampliﬁcation
revealed that duplications (56.7%) or deletions (21.9%) in PMP22 were reported for most of
the positive results; next, mutations were detected in GJB1 (6.7%), MPZ (5.3%), and MFN2
(4.3%). GJB1 deletions and mutations in the residual genes were 5.3% of the anomalies. Of
the individuals presenting a positive genetic outcome in a CMT-related gene, 94.9% had a
mutation in one of the following four genes ( PMP22 ,GJB1 ,MPZ , orMFN2 ) [8]. Effective pharmacological treatments for CMT are currently lacking. This review dis-
cusses the treatment of CMT with the four main causative genes.

In line with this idea, stimulation of the rat
sciatic nerve with ATP induces increases in the Ca
2? concentration in both the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix
in myelinating SCs. The ATP-induced cytoplasmic Ca2? increase is mediated by the signaling cascade consisting of
the activation of the P2Y2 purinergic receptor (P2RY2),production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP
3) via
hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by
phospholipase C, and Ca2?release from intracellular Ca2? stores via IP 3receptors. This P2Y2-IP 3-mediated cyto-
plasmic Ca2?mobilization subsequently induces
mitochondrial Ca2?signaling via the MCU. The physiological signiﬁcance of mitochondrial Ca2? signaling in myelinating SCs has been examined in vivo by
disrupting the P2RY2-IP 3-MCU pathway using shRNA for
P2RY2 (shP2RY2), or IP 3-5 phosphatase (5ppase), an
enzyme that suppress IP 3receptor-mediated Ca2?release
by rapidly hydrolyzing IP 3[56–62], or shRNA for MCU
(shMCU). Expression of shP2RY2, 5ppase, or shMCU in
myelinating SCs results in increased levels of phosphory-
lated AMPK, suggesting a critical role for P2RY2-IP 3-
MCU signaling in energy metabolism in myelinating SCs.

Somewhat surprisingly, of the 2,080 DEGs that are induced in the C22 model, only 43 were found to be induced in 
expression analyses of different time points after nerve injury (41, 
44, 45), including the Pou3f1 transcription factor expressed in pro -
myelinating Schwann cells as well as other transcription factors, 
such as Sox4 and Id2  (Supplemental Figure 2, E and F). Indeed, 
none of the previously described c-Jun  target genes (41) were 
induced in the C22 model, indicating that other transcriptional 
programs were enacted by PMP22 overexpression in this model. Relatively few cytokines/chemokines were induced in the C22 model, with the exception of Cxcl14  (46), and immune cell mark -
ers were not an enriched gene ontology category with this data set 
(Supplemental Figure 2G). We next determined whether ASO-mediated suppression 
could restore gene-expression levels toward WT levels and 
found 97 DEGs that behaved in this manner. Among this set, 76 overlapped with the 746 DEGs that significantly changed in the comparison of C22 and WT cohorts at 5 or 15 weeks (Sup -

Cuffdiff and False Discovery Rate (FDR) estimated byBenjamini –Hochberg method was used to create a set of
signi ﬁcant genes that pass FDR <5% cut-off. All the genes that
met the FDR 5% cut-off also had at least 4.8-fold change
difference in all comparisons. Samples were normalised usingupper quartile normalisation and considered signi ﬁcant at FDR <
5%. Gene networks, canonical pathways, and functional analyses
were generated through the use of ingenuity pathway analysis
(IPA) ( https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-

however, since Cuffdiff uses beta negative binomial distribution as
an underlying statistical model, the signi ﬁcance takes into account
the read count nature of RNA sequencing data and gives an extralevel of con ﬁdence compared to using only fold change.

CMT1A exhibits dysregulated lipid biosynthesis
Comparative microarrays were used to compare gene expression from sciatic nerves of WT rats with mildly and
severely affected CMT1A model rats expressing a 3rd WT PMP22 allele [ 24]. It was found that dysregulation of
22 lipid metabolism genes correlated with disease severity. In both mildly and severely affected animals mostexamined lipid metabolism genes were down-regulated at both 1 week and 9 weeks of age. Interestingly, there
was an age-dependent switch between mildly affected and severely affected rats with mildly affected rats exhibit-
ing more lipid biosynthetic gene dysregulation at 1 week of age and severely affected rats exhibiting more lipidbiosynthesis gene dysregulation at 9 weeks of age. Follow-up quantitative PCR experiments validated Adipoq,

Cnp1 knockout mice, with the Thy1-EYFPnuc transgene ( Wehr
et al., 2006 ). Despite the axonal pathology, CPN loss was not a
feature of Plp1 and Cnp1 mutants as quantiﬁed by EYFPnuc+
cell counting ( Figure S2 D). We then isolated CPNs from cortical
layer ﬁve by ﬂuorescence-directed laser microdissection from 1
to 12 months of age for transcriptional proﬁling ( Figures 2 A and
S2E). Transcriptional proﬁling revealed 412 differentially ex-
pressed genes in CPN from Cnp1 knockout mice and 104
genes from Plp1 knockout mice compared with Thy1-EYFPnuc
controls (adjusted [adj.] p < 0.001, Benjamin-Hochberg correc-
tion > 1.8-fold changes) ( Figure S2 F). Surprisingly, by gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA), the gene set ‘‘cholesterol meta-
bolism’’ was upregulated in CPNs of both mutants ( Figure 2 B). This included genes involved in cholesterol synthesis ( Hmgcr ,
Fdft1 ,Cyp51 ,Dhcr24 ) and transport ( Ldlr,Apoe )(Figure 2 C;

How can PMP22  overexpression  change  MYC expression  as rationalized by chatGPT  
 
Certainly! Let’s explore how overexpression of  PMP22 
(Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 ) could influence  MYC expression, considering mechanisms 
in cell biology and biochemistry . Backgroun d 
• PMP2 2 is a transmembrane glycoprotein primarily 
expressed in Schwann cells, contributing to myelin 
sheath formation. It is also involved in regulating cell 
growth, adhesion, and apoptosis. • MYC is a transcription factor that regulates genes 
involved in proliferation , metabolism, and apoptosis. Possible Mechanisms Linking PMP22 
Overexpression to MYC Expressio n 
1. Altered Signaling Pathway s: 
• PMP22 is known to interact with signaling pathways, particularly those involving cell 
growth and differentiation. Overexpressi on may activate or inhibit signaling cascades 
like PI3K -AKT or MAP K. 
• These pathways can modulate  MYC expression directly or indirectly through upstream 
regulators such as  mTO R or transcription factors like  NF-κB.

of atorvastatin after 5 days of treatment allowed recovery of
pThr231Tau/Tau indicating reversible dynamic regulation ( Fig-
ure S2 C). Statin-treated neurons elicited a (normal) physiological
response to statin treatment exempliﬁed by upregulation of
cholesterol-synthetic proteins ( Figures S2 D and S2E; Table
S4). Statins have recently been reported to induce the degrada-
tion of mutant p53 by reduction of mevalonate-5-phosphate
(MVP) ( Parrales et al., 2016 ). The effects of statins on pTau are
not mediated by MVP, as both MVP and its direct downstreammetabolite, MVA-5PP, rescued the effect of statin treatment ( Fig-
ure 2 B). More distal of MVA-5PP, the MVA pathway branches
into non-sterol isoprenoid (protein prenylation) pathways and acholesterol synthetic pathway ( Figure 2 A). Inhibition of the
respective non-sterol isoprenoid pathways (by geranyl- or farne-

For further details on the molecular composition of these domains, we address the reader to seminal reviews on this topic [9 –12]. The outermost region of a myelinated fiber is not uni-
form but interrupted by appositions between the abaxonal Schwann cell membrane (the layer facing ECM, which is opposite to the adaxonal membrane) and the outer layer of the compact myelin [13] (Fig. 1b, d). These contacts are formed by the interaction between the ECM and the βDG (dystroglycan)-DRP2 (dystrophyn-related 2)-PRX (Peri-axin) complex, which intracellularly is linked to the F-actin cytoskeleton [14– 17]. These membrane appositions thus 
form longitudinal cytoplasmic channels called Cajal bands, which represent fast tracks for transport of molecules and organelles from the perinuclear region to the periphery [13]. Consistent with this, these channels contain microtubules, intermediate filaments, and F-actin. Cajal bands are also enriched in caveolae-mediating endocytosis from the extra-cellular environment, thus suggesting that these structures are also relevant for Schwann cell metabolism [1 , 4].

The enzymatic mechanisms are dependent mainly on the action of phospho-
lipases, each of which could present a different substrate specificity [53–58]. In addition, 
it has been shown that cytochrome c upon oxidative stress can act as a plasmalogenase , 
releasing the alkyl chain at the sn-1 position of the glycerol moiety [59]. Figure 2. Metabolism of plasmalogen. (A) Biosynthesis pathway. Initial biochemical reactions start in the peroxisome 
with the production of 1 -acyl-dihydroxyacetone phosphate (1 -acyl DHAP) and delivery of 1 -alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-
phosphate (AGP) to the ER. In the ER, AGP undergoes four consecutive biochemical reactions to yield PE-Pls. PC-Pls is

These findings were consistent with the motor behavior and electrophysiology charac-terizations of the C22 cohort described in Figure 1. This was, to our knowledge, the first RNA-seq profiling of 
a CMT1A model, and the analysis showed some categories of 
genes in common with microarray profiles of other CMT1A mod-
els (34, 37 , 38). For example, there was a significant decrease in cholesterol and lipid biosynthetic genes as well as myelin-related genes in 5-week-old C22 compared with WT littermates (Supple -
mental Figure 2, C and F). The increased gene categories include a number involved in cell signaling, as well as those involved in axon guidance mechanisms (RhoA , Plxna1, and Rac1 ) and inte -
grin signaling (Itgb8 ) (Supplemental Figure 2D). Expression of 
myelin inhibitors such as Id2 , Id4, and Ednrb  was also increased, 
suggesting an unfavorable environment for remyelination (Sup -
plemental Figure 2E). Dysregulation of several transcription fac-tors regulating Schwann cell differentiation was also observed in the C22 mice (Supplemental Figure 2F).

Principal component analysis (PCA) of these 76 DEGs gen-erated a first principal component (PCA1) that accounted for 
80.1% variance. PCA1 further demonstrated a transcriptional 
profile of C22 mice treated with ASO1 for 9 weeks similar to that of WT mice (Figure 2C). Genes with the largest eigenvalues or weights in PCA1, such as Bzw2 , Cuedc2, Mpzl1, Padi2 , and Snx16, 
were previously found to be regulated by Sox10 (47), a crucial regulator of several phases of Schwann cell development, sug -
gesting reprogramming of dysregulated Schwann cells following ASO treatment. Our studies did not reveal statistically signifi-cant changes in Sox10 mRNA. It is likely that a Sox10-interacting 
factor is responsible for these changes, since Sox10 interacts with 
a wide range of transcription factors (47). CMAP, MNCV, and distal motor latency were also measured 
in these mice. Thus, Pearson correlation was computed between expression of each of the strongly weighted PCA genes and each of these electrophysiological measures to determine whether nov-el disease biomarkers could be identified.

Concerning radial myelin growth and thickness, several negative regulators have been identified most of them converging on the NRG1 pathway [1 ]. As 
described before, TACE secretase cleaves NRG1 type III and negatively regulates its activity and myelination [65]. PTEN phosphatase downregulates 
 PIP3 levels and Akt-mTORC1 
activation, thus also negatively regulating myelination [86, 87]. Of note, the Dlg1/SAP97 (Discs Large 1/synapse asso-ciated protein 97) is a scaffolding protein of the MAGUK family that has been shown to potentiate PTEN activity and to negatively regulate the Akt-mTORC1 signaling [103]. In turn, Dlg1 is negatively regulated by the Kif13b unconven-tional kinesin motor protein, that promotes p38ɣ -MAPK 
Dlg1 phosphorylation and ubiquitination [104]. Kif13b is thus a positive regulator of myelination. REDD1 (Regu-lated in development and DNA damage responses 1/Ddti4) is another negative regulator of mTORC1, which acts by stimulating TSC1/2. Consistent with this, Ddit4 KO nerves display increased myelin thickness [105].

However, it was
found that ABCA1-dependent cholesterol ef ﬂux was decreased. This was detected as a sharp decrease in ApoE
secretion (along with cholesterol) in PMP22 KO SC cultures. Decreased cholesterol ef ﬂux was explained by
observation that traf ﬁcking of ABCA1 to the plasma membrane was signi ﬁcantly decreased. This was found
when cyclosporin A-blocking endocytosis of plasma membrane-associated ABCA1 resulted in no effect on
levels of secreted cholesterol, suggesting minimal levels of ABCA1 at the plasma membrane of PMP22 KOmouse SCs. Reduced levels of ABCA1 at the plasma membrane were con ﬁrmed by cell surface immuno ﬂuores-
cence microscopy in both nerves and cultured SCs. These results in PMP22 KO mice suggest an important role for PMP22 in promoting ABCA1-mediated chol-
esterol export from SCs, although the mechanism remains uncertain. Interestingly, PMP22 protein levels in
ABCA1 KO mouse nerves were increased 1.5-fold over WT while other myelin genes MAG, MPZ, and p75
remained relatively unchanged.

Cholesterol and APOE4 affect myelination
Oligodendrocytes myelinate the central nervous system and the bio -
availability of cholesterol is rate-limiting for the formation and main-
tenance of myelin29. We reasoned that altered cholesterol localization 
and homeostasis in APOE4 oligodendrocytes may impair myelina -
tion. Compared with APOE3/3 post-mortem human oligodendrocytes, 
APOE3/4 and APOE4/4 post-mortem human oligodendrocytes exhibited 
downregulation of myelin-associated genes (PLLP, MYRF, MAG , OPALIN, 
MOG and PLP1; Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 13). This pattern per -
sisted in cells from individuals without AD pathology, suggesting that 
these myelin-associated genes may be influenced by the APOE genotype 
and not confounded by pathology (Extended Data Fig. 8a and Sup -
plementary Table 13). Decreased myelin-associated gene expression 
occurred concomitantly with increased expression of genes associ -
ated with cholesterol homeostasis, including MVK, FDPS, ABCG1 , IDI1, 
LDLR, INSIG1, SREBF2, SQLE, DHCR7, DHCR24, FDFT1 and LSS  (Fig.

During differentiation, myelination requires extensive 
cytoskeletal dynamics to modify the growing membrane, which wraps radially the axon and expands longitudinally, and to assembly stable clusters of molecules mediating glia-glia, glia-axon, and glia-extracellular matrix interactions [1, 4, 10]. Recently, hypomyelination and impaired actin 
cytoskeleton rearrangements have been demonstrated in a mutant model lacking the PI4KA kinase, which generates PtdIns4P  at the plasma membrane [119]. The importance 
of cytoskeletal dynamics later in myelination has been fur -
ther supported by other models, which reproduce myelin defects typical of inherited Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropa-thies in human. Loss of MTMR2 (Myotubularin-related 2) causes demyelinating CMT4B1 with myelin outfoldings [120]. Recently, Guerrero-Valero et al. found that loss of 
MTMR2 is associated with increased levels of PdtIns(3,5)P
2 
phosphoinositide and overactivation of both mTORC1 and RhoA GTPase pathways, leading to myelin outfoldings [94].

2 A ). Apart from terms directly connected to MYC
activity, we also observed dynamic changes of immune-relatedpathways in the process of acquiring AZD8055 resistance ( Fig. S2, A and B ). The interferon α/γresponse pathways were
significantly downregulated in resistant tumors ( Fig. 3 A ),
indicating a potential role of MYC in suppressing interferonsignaling ( Muthalagu et al., 2020 ;Swaminathan et al., 2020 ;Kim
et al., 2016 ;Zimmerli et al., 2022 ). TF target enrichment analysis
demonstrated that downregulated genes in resistant tumorswere significantly enriched by the targets of immune-associatedtranscription regulators such as IRF8 and SMRT, supporting the
suppression of immune response in resistant tumors ( Fig. 2, C
and D ). Likewise, other immune processes such as IL6 –JAK–STAT3 signaling, IL2 –STAT5 signaling, inflammatory response,
and complement were similarly triggered by short-term treat-ment of AZD8055 but became suppressed during resistance ac-quisition ( Fig. 3 A andFig. S2 C ). Moreover, immune infiltration
as assessed by Estimation of Stromal and Immune cells in Ma-
lignant Tumours using Expression data (ESTIMATE; Yoshihara
et al., 2013 ) was predicted to be enriched in sensitive tumors,
while resistant tumors showed an immune exclusion phenotype(Fig.

Expression of Bzw2 , a 
repressor of translation as a nonfunctional mimic of eIF2α, was negatively correlated with electrophysiological measurements, while higher expression levels of lipid synthetic genes, Ugt8a and Scd5, were found to be positively correlated with these measures (Figure 2, D–F, and Supplemental Figure 3), suggesting they could serve as additional disease biomarkers. Importantly, while ASO1 treatment in WT mice reduced 
Pmp22 expression (Supplemental Figure 2H), no significant tran-scriptional changes were observed between WT mice treated with PBS or ASO1 for 9 weeks (Figure 2, A, C–F). These data suggested that approximately 35% suppression of endogenous Pmp22 mRNA is tolerated, although further dose titration studies will be needed. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses 
using the sciatic lysates from the dose-response cohort in Figure 
1 further confirmed the RNA-seq findings. Specifically, there were 
dose-dependent increases in the mRNA levels of several lipid bio -
synthetic and myelin genes (Figure 2, G and H, and Supplemental 
Figure 4, A–C) as well as dose-dependent decreases of dedifferen-
tiation markers and myelin inhibitor (Figure 2, I and J, and Supple -
mental Figure 4, D–F) following 9 weeks of ASO1 treatment.

Consistent with previous reports (33), pretreatment/baseline grip strength (102.5 ± 4.9 g in WT treated with PBS vs. 60.1 ± 2.4 g in C22 treated with PBS, Figure 1C) and the rotarod performance (161.9 ± 10.3 s in WT treated with PBS vs. 85.1 ± 8.0 s in C22 treated with PBS, Figure 1D) of 5-week-old C22 mice were 
significantly impaired compared with those in WT controls. We 
observed a significant loss of grip strength over the 9-week testing period in C22 mice treated with PBS (60.1 ± 2.4 g at pretreatment/baseline vs. 42.2 ± 3.5 g at 9 weeks, P < 0.001). ASO1 treatment not only slowed progression at low doses, but also reversed the decline

The intracellular domain of dystroglycan interacts 
with DRP2 and L-PRX. DG (dystroglycan) conditional KO in Schwann cells display a neuropathic phenotype morpho-logically characterized by irregular folding of myelin, dis-organization of microvilli, and consequent altered clustering of 
 Na+ channels at the node [14]. These features are not 
typical of laminin mutants and their receptors in develop-ment such as β1 integrin, suggesting that this phenotype is not due to altered ECM-Schwann cell communication. One hypothesis is that loss of function of proteins within the DG complex in Schwann cells leads to myelin instability [14]. DRP2 and L-PRX anchor DG in the Schwann cell apposi-tions, which defines the boundaries of the cytoplasm-filled adjacent regions, the Cajal bands (Fig. 1b, d) [13, 15, 17]. Consistent with this, in addition to Cajal bands disruption, loss of either PRX or of DRP2 is associated with myelin abnormalities that share similarities with those observed in the DG mutant. Other adhesion molecules involved in myelin stability in 
this region is the integrin α6 β4.

CMT1, CMT4, and CMTX1 and are most often caused by mutations in proteins

Of note, some studies have associated these common variants of CMT with
disturbances in lipid metabolism in SCs that could impair myelin maintenance.First, a rat model of CMT1A, the most frequent subtype of CMT1, revealed altered
lipid metabolism in sciatic nerves of animals with severe neuropathy relative to

Patients typically present a “classical
Genes 2023 ,14, 1391 3 of 17
CMT phenotype” within the ﬁrst 20 years of life, characterized by progressive muscle
feebleness, atrophy, decreased sensory function, hyporeﬂexia, and skeletal malformations. Although the disorder progresses slowly and patients may require ankle–foot orthotics,
they generally maintain ambulation and experience no signiﬁcant impact during their life
span. Extensive research on PMP22 and its role in CMT1A has advanced our knowledge of
the illness and improved the potential therapeutic techniques [3]. 2.1.2. CMT1B (MPZ)
CMT1B accounts for 10% of the total CMT1 cases and arises from MPZ mutations,
located on chromosome 1q22-q23; the majority of the peripheral nerve myelin protein
is encoded by CMT1B. The role of Po protein as a homophilic adhesion molecule is to
enable myelin compaction [ 10].MPZ variants lead to the etiology of demyelinating neu-
ropathy CMT1B (OMIM 118200). Some mutations result in axonal neuropathy CMT2I/J
(OMIM 607677/607736) and the additionally critical juvenile-onset Dejerine–Sottas syn-
drome (OMIM 145900) and congenital hypomyelination neuropathy 2 (OMIM 618184).

After completing the 
differentiation protocol, 65–81% of cells were immunoreactive for MBP 
and 69–82% were immunoreactive for PLP1 across cultures (Extended 
Data Fig. 5c). To further validate iPS-cell-derived oligodendroglia, 
gene expression was compared with pseudobulk signatures of major 
cell types from snRNA-seq analysis of the post-mortem human brain. b

Therefore, the overexpression of these genes may
have a therapeutic effect on CMT1B. 3.2.9. Colony-Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor Inhibitor
The neuropathic phenotype is promoted by low-grade inﬂammation from phagocytiz-
ing macrophages in mice models for CMT1A, CMT1B, and CMTX1. Colony-stimulating
factor (CSF1) is a macrophage activator expressed by endoneurial ﬁbroblasts. It mediates
macrophage-related neural impairment in mice and humans with CMT. Consequently, oral
administration of the CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX5622 followed by a vigorous
decrease in the number of macrophages in the peripheral nerves of Cx32def mice; more-
over, long-term CSF1R inhibition was reported to improve axonal integrity in these mice. However, although long-term CSF1R inhibition reduced the neuropathic patterns in P0het
mutants, it did not produce the same effect in PMP22 tg mutants [52]. 3.2.10. Sodium Channel Blockers
Dysmyelination in Mpz knockout mice associates with the ectopic expression of the
sensory neuron-speciﬁc sodium channel isoform NaV1.8 on motor axons.

In hamster and mouse models
of atherosclerosis, oral administration of PE-Pls decreased atherosclerosis lesion and total
cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in serum [ 113,123]. In transgenic mice with small (due to
depressed PI3K signaling) or failing hearts (due to dilated cardiomyopathy), OG treatment
increased both PC-Pls and PE-Pls levels but did not impact heart size or function [ 114]. PRT had also shown antitumor properties. In mice, oral administration of shark liver oil
(enriched in AG) or shark-liver-oil-puriﬁed AG decreased tumor growth, vascularization,
and dissemination [115]. Membranes 2021 ,11, 838 8 of 18
