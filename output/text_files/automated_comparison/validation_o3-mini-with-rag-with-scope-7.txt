Below is the tab‐separated table summarizing the evaluation of each user‐provided pathway against the ground truth list:

Pathway	                           Validation (Hit or no hit)	 Novel or not	      Matched Ground Truth Pathway
Axon Guidance and Neuronal Migration	    Hit	                      Not Novel	      Axonal Guidance Signaling
Myelination and Glial Support	            Hit	                      Not Novel	      Myelination Signaling Pathway
Neural Progenitor Maintenance and Neurogenesis	no hit	             Potentially Novel	
Synaptic Function and Plasticity	        Hit	                      Not Novel	      Activation of NMDA receptors and postsynaptic events
Extracellular Matrix Remodeling and Cell Adhesion	Hit	      Not Novel	      Extracellular matrix organization; cell adhesion
Neurotrophic and Growth Factor Signaling	Hit	                      Not Novel	      NGF processing; Neuregulin Signaling

Narrative Summary:
Of the six pathways provided, five clearly correspond to established ground truth pathways. “Axon Guidance and Neuronal Migration” matches the well‐characterized “Axonal Guidance Signaling,” while “Myelination and Glial Support” aligns with the “Myelination Signaling Pathway.” “Synaptic Function and Plasticity” is captured by the pathway related to NMDA receptor activation and postsynaptic events, and “Extracellular Matrix Remodeling and Cell Adhesion” overlaps with both “Extracellular matrix organization” and “cell adhesion” processes. In contrast, “Neural Progenitor Maintenance and Neurogenesis” did not find a direct counterpart in the ground truth and therefore appears to be a potentially novel or underexplored concept. Finally, “Neurotrophic and Growth Factor Signaling” is supported by signaling events associated with NGF processing and Neuregulin Signaling – both important in neurotrophic regulation. This overall analysis affirms the biological relevance of most of the pathways while pointing out an opportunity for further exploration in neural progenitor dynamics.
