## g:Profiler Comparison Summary
**Comparison of user-supplied (GPT) pathways with gProfiler ground-truth list**

| Pathway (GPT List) | Validation (Hit/No Hit) | Novel or Common | Matched Pathway (gProfiler List) | Annotation Term (GO/KEGG/REAC) |
|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Synaptic Plasticity & Signaling | **Hit** | Common | Regulation of signaling • Cell surface receptor signaling pathway | GO:0023051 • GO:0007166 |
| Axon Guidance & Neuronal Connectivity | **Hit** | Common | Axon guidance • Axon extension involved in axon guidance • Neuron projection extension involved in neuron projection guidance | KEGG:04360 • GO:0048846 • GO:1902284 |
| Myelination & Glial Differentiation | **Hit** | Common | Myelin sheath | GO:0043209 |
| Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport | **Hit** | Common | Cell motility • Vesicle • Regulation of cellular component organization | GO:0048870 • GO:0031982 • GO:0051128 |
| Neurogenesis & Neural Development | **Hit** | Common | System development • Developmental process • Olfactory bulb interneuron development | GO:0048731 • GO:0032502 • GO:0021891 |

### Interpretative summary
• All five user-provided pathways have clear or close functional counterparts in the gProfiler result set, so every entry is considered a **hit**.  
• No entirely novel pathways (i.e., absent from the ground-truth list) were detected.

Biological coherence of validated pathways  
1. Synaptic plasticity & signaling is integral to learning/memory and aligns with broad signaling terms captured by gProfiler (regulation of signaling, cell-surface receptor signaling).  
2. Axon guidance & neuronal connectivity directly overlaps the KEGG Axon guidance pathway as well as GO terms for axon/neurite extension, underscoring correct mapping.  
3. Myelination & glial differentiation corresponds to the “myelin sheath” GO category, reflecting oligodendrocyte activity essential for rapid nerve conduction.  
4. Cytoskeletal dynamics & intracellular transport relate to vesicle trafficking and cell motility, both represented in the ground-truth list, emphasizing cytoskeleton-dependent transport processes.  
5. Neurogenesis & neural development are encompassed by several high-level developmental GO terms (system development, developmental process), capturing the broad neurodevelopmental theme.

Potential gaps were minimal because the ground-truth list already contains high-level umbrella terms that capture most neural processes.

Summary  
• SIPA1L1 (SPAR), MEF2C, and EFNA5 each have GeneCards GO annotations and peer-reviewed publications that clearly support their participation in synaptic plasticity & signaling.  
• For PRSS12, SYNPR, LRRTM3, and CNTN6, relevant GO terms are present in GeneCards, but no verified academic papers explicitly linking them to synaptic plasticity were located under the specified search constraints; these represent current evidence gaps that should be addressed with further experimental or literature review.

Summary  
• GeneCards GO annotations link all listed genes to processes relevant to axon guidance or neuronal connectivity, providing general bioinformatic support.  
• Verified peer-reviewed literature was located for Ntn1, Slit2, and Plxnb1, each clearly demonstrating functional roles in axon guidance.  
• No suitable, verifiable publications were found for Sema4f, Sema3g, Robo2, Srgap1, Dpysl3, Dpysl5, or Cdh13 that explicitly connect them to axon guidance or neuronal connectivity under the required criteria; these associations therefore remain unsupported by primary literature evidence in this assessment.

### Myelination & Glial Differentiation
**Genes involved:** Mpz, Mag, Pmp22, Prx, Drp2, Gldn, Mal

| Pathway Name | Gene | Evidence from GeneCards (GO Terms) | Evidence from Academic Literature (Year, Authors, Verified Exact Title, Journal)<br>> "Quotation" |

Summary
• All seven queried genes (MPZ, MAG, PMP22, PRX, DRP2, GLDN, and MAL) possess Gene Ontology annotations in GeneCards that directly reference “myelination,” supporting a bioinformatic association with the pathway “Myelination & Glial Differentiation.”

• A targeted search of PubMed and Google Scholar did not yield peer-reviewed articles that could be verified with exact titles and quotations explicitly linking each individual gene to the combined pathway term “Myelination & Glial Differentiation” under the strict citation rules provided. Consequently, no academic-literature evidence is supplied for these genes.

Gap
• While GeneCards GO annotations consistently support involvement in myelination, the absence of immediately verifiable, exact-title literature quotations highlights a documentation gap under the current strict search criteria.

### Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport
**Genes involved:** Tuba4a, Tubb4a, Kif1a, Septin4, Septin5, Pfn2, Rab10

| Pathway Name | Gene | Evidence from GeneCards (GO Terms) | Evidence from Academic Literature (Year, Authors, Verified Exact Title, Journal)<br>> "Quotation" |

| Cytoskeletal Dynamics & Intracellular Transport | Tuba4a | GO:0007017 (microtubule-based process) [View GeneCards](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=TUBA4A) | "No evidence found." |

Summary  
• GeneCards offers GO annotations consistent with roles in cytoskeleton or intracellular transport for all seven genes.  
• Peer-reviewed literature conclusively supports involvement only for KIF1A; no verified papers explicitly linking the other six genes to this pathway were located under the required search constraints.  
• Consequently, strong combined evidence exists for KIF1A, whereas clear literature confirmation is still lacking for Tuba4a, Tubb4a, Septin4, Septin5, Pfn2, and Rab10.

Summary
• GeneCards GO annotations support the putative involvement of all eleven genes in neurogenesis or neural development–related processes.  
• Verified peer-reviewed evidence was located for Nes (Nestin) and Numb, directly linking them to neural development.  
• No suitable, verifiable publications were found for Id2, Dyrk1a, Atf5, Klf9, Msi1, Peg3, Igfbp3, Lifr or Cxcl12 under the specified search constraints, leaving their pathway associations unsubstantiated by academic literature in this assessment.
