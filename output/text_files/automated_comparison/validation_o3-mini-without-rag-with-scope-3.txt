Narrative Summary:

Four of the six pathways (“Axon Guidance and Neuronal Migration”, “Synaptic Function and Neural Signaling”, “Myelination and Neural Connectivity”, “Extracellular Matrix Remodeling and Cell Adhesion in Neural Development”, and “Cytoskeletal Dynamics and Axonal Transport”) show clear hits against the ground truth. Their underlying biology mirrors key neural processes already catalogued—ranging from axon guidance and synaptic communication to myelination and the regulation of cell–matrix interactions and cytoskeletal dynamics. In contrast, “Neural Progenitor Maintenance and Neurogenesis” did not match any of the provided ground truth pathways, marking it as a novel finding in this context. These results underscore that while most of your identified pathways are well‐documented in neural biology, the “Neural Progenitor Maintenance and Neurogenesis” pathway might represent an underexplored or alternative regulatory process that could merit further investigation.
