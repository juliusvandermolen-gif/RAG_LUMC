Interpretative Summary:
• The “Neuronal Development and Axon Guidance” pathway was validated as a hit—the “axon guidance” process is explicitly listed among the ground truth pathways. This suggests that the neuronal signaling events you captured are well recognized.
• “Extracellular Matrix Organization” directly matches the corresponding ground truth entry, confirming its established role in cellular architecture and signaling.
• In contrast, “Metabolic Processes and Redox Homeostasis,” “Immune Response and Inflammatory Signaling,” and “Stress Response and Protein Quality Control” did not yield any direct hits. Although these processes are broadly studied, they are not specifically labeled in the provided ground truth list. As such, these may represent novel or more conceptual groupings that could warrant further investigation to determine their detailed biological underpinnings.
  
Overall, the results indicate that while some of your identified pathways align with well‐established processes, a few areas might capture broader or less defined biological concepts that could be considered for further exploration.
