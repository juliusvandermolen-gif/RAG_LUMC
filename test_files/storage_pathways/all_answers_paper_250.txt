The system of interacting proteins provided includes a diverse array of proteins that are primarily involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and cell adhesion processes. Several proteins in this list, such as Adamts17, Adamtsl3, and Adamtsl1, are members of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family, which are known to play critical roles in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix. These proteins are involved in the processing of procollagens and other ECM components, contributing to tissue structure and integrity.

Additionally, proteins like Cntn6 (Contactin 6), Ntn1 (Netrin 1), and Sema4f (Semaphorin 4F) are involved in cell adhesion and guidance, particularly in the nervous system. These proteins facilitate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, which are crucial for the development and maintenance of tissue architecture.

Collagen-related proteins such as Col9a3, Col11a1, and Col15a1 are integral components of the ECM, providing structural support and influencing cell behavior. These collagens are essential for the formation of fibrillar networks that maintain tissue integrity and function.

Furthermore, proteins like Integrins (e.g., Itga7, Itga8) and Cadherins (e.g., Cdh13) are key players in cell adhesion, mediating interactions between cells and the ECM. These interactions are vital for processes such as cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation.

The presence of growth factors and signaling molecules such as Wnt5a and Igfbp3 (Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3) further supports the involvement of this protein system in ECM organization and cell adhesion. These factors modulate cellular responses to the ECM and influence tissue morphogenesis and repair.

Overall, the proteins in this system are predominantly involved in the organization and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, as well as in mediating cell adhesion and signaling, which are essential for maintaining tissue structure and function.
